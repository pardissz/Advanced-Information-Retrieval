# Advanced Information Retrieval Course Project

This project is part of my Advanced Information Retrieval course and is divided into four phases:

- **Phase 1**: Text preprocessing, query modification, index construction, boolean retrieval, and index compression.

- **Phase 2**: Vector models, scoring and evaluation of retrieval system, and probabilistic models.

- **Phase 3**: Embedding text classification, dimension reduction, text clustering, and cluster pruning.

- **Phase 4**: Crawler implementation, LSI, fine-tuning BerTweet, neural networks, and Hits algorithm implementation.

Each phase has its own code and documents.
