Embryonic stem (ES) cells are considered to exist in a ground state if shielded from differentiation triggers. Here we show that FGF4 and TGF\u03b2 signaling pathway inhibitors, designated R2i, not only provide the ground state pluripotency in production and maintenance of na\u00efve ES cells from blastocysts of different mouse strains, but also maintain ES cells with higher genomic integrity following long-term cultivation compared with the chemical inhibition of the FGF4 and GSK3 pathways, known as 2i. Global transcriptome analysis of the ES cells highlights augmented BMP4 signaling pathway. The crucial role of the BMP4 pathway in maintaining the R2i ground state pluripotency is demonstrated by BMP4 receptor suppression, resulting in differentiation and cell death. In conclusion, by inhibiting TGF\u03b2 and FGF signaling pathways, we introduce a novel defined approach to efficiently establish the ground state pluripotency.", "PublicationYear": "2013", "Authors": ["Seyedeh-Nafiseh Hassani", "Mehdi Totonchi", "Ali Sharifi-Zarchi", "Sepideh Mollamohammadi", "Mohammad Pakzad", "Sharif Moradi", "Azam Samadian", "Najmehsadat Masoudi", "Shahab Mirshahvaladi", "Alireza Farrokhi", "Boris Greber", "Marcos Jes{\\'u}s Ara{\\'u}zo-Bravo", "Davood Sabour", "Mehdi Sadeghi", "Ghasem Hosseini Salekdeh", "Hamid Gourabi", "Hans Robert Sch{\\\"o}ler", "Hossein Baharvand"], "RelatedTopics": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "References": ["f13918130b9b928758b908a3989aab5ba9cc9f67", "5c623414ce6d482e93372f0b580ea6a228bca351", "982c52d55462395cc8feae01be81e35467fb71ba", "ce86b14fa6e8998f135b4c570731d4efab8e3fea", "c35f09bff4443d14f96ef69acb102091d8557396", "567365c2522a4d88c7ef4a75e24668829f602b65", "931b3299b61d769dbf7d94ebfbd48e50ecaf2473", "c600e4e12b208b2fdfa78b6965e720df00de3e6c", "7fa779ef385b024a2c43f6c294eff23e9e0ae997", "e44aa80c6e4be7b483789525b572596ccce0ad87"], "ReferenceCount": 40, "CitationCount": 63}, {"URL": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Treatment-of-human-embryonic-stem-cells-with-of-and-Tahamtani-Azarnia/788db0c4d5b98e835027cc2331419bf6b26f1c77", "ID": "788db0c4d5b98e835027cc2331419bf6b26f1c77", "Title": "Treatment of human embryonic stem cells with different combinations of priming and inducing factors toward definitive endoderm.", "Abstract": "Data have indicated that hESCs primed with Rapa, and induced by a lower concentration of activin A, could lead to DE that had the capability to further differentiate into HLCs and PP cells, but not PE cells. Despite the enormous progress in studying definitive endoderm (DE) differentiation from human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), none of the reported protocols have produced a universal, cost-effective, and competent DE with the capability to further differentiate into endodermal derivatives. In this study, by using a 2-step differentiation strategy, we have treated hESCs for 1 day with \\\"priming\\\" small molecules (SM), [stauprimide, NSC-308848, rapamycin (Rapa), and/or CHIR] and for the next 3 days with \\\"inducing\\\" SM (LY294002, cymarin, IDE1, and/or IDE2) in conjunction with activin A. In the positive control group, we treated hESCs with Wnt3a (25\u2009ng/mL) for 1 day and activin A (100\u2009ng/mL; W/A100-A100) for the next 3 days. Gene expression analysis showed that treatment of hESCs with 100\u2009nM Rapa and 50\u2009ng/mL activin A (Rapa-A50) out of 25 combinations of factors gave rise to higher expressions of 2 DE-specific genes, SOX17 and FOXA2. Similar results were obtained after treating 2 other hESC lines with this regimen. To investigate the competency of Rapa-A50-induced DE for further differentiation into endodermal derivatives, these cells and W/A100-A100-induced DE cells (positive control) were further differentiated into pancreatic progenitors (PP), then into pancreatic endocrine (PE) cells using 5 previously described differentiation protocols. Gene analysis of differentiated cells showed that the established protocols were insufficient to enable universal differentiation into PE, whereas Rapa-A50-induced DE cells were more competent for PP differentiation in a protocol-dependent manner. Additionally, Rapa-A50-induced DE had the capability to differentiate into hepatocyte-like cells (HLCs) as efficiently as W/A100-A100-induced DE. These data have indicated that hESCs primed with Rapa, and induced by a lower concentration of activin A, could lead to DE that had the capability to further differentiate into HLCs and PP cells, but not PE cells.

Many problems in applied machine learning deal with graphs (also called networks), including social networks, security, web data mining, protein function prediction, and genome informatics. The kernel paradigm beautifully decouples the learning algorithm from the underlying geometric space, which renders graph kernels important for the aforementioned applications. In this article, we give a new graph kernel, which we call graph traversal edit distance (GTED). We introduce the GTED problem and give the first polynomial time algorithm for it. Informally, the GTED is the minimum edit distance between two strings formed by the edge labels of respective Eulerian traversals of the two graphs. Also, GTED is motivated by and provides the first mathematical formalism for sequence co-assembly and de novo variation detection in bioinformatics. We demonstrate that GTED admits a polynomial time algorithm using a linear program in the graph product space that is guaranteed to yield an integer solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to this problem. We also give a linear programming relaxation algorithm for a lower bound on GTED. We use GTED as a graph kernel and evaluate it by computing the accuracy of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on a few data sets in the literature. Our results suggest that our kernel outperforms many of the common graph kernels in the tested data sets. As a second set of experiments, we successfully cluster viral genomes using GTED on their assembly graphs obtained from de novo assembly of next-generation sequencing reads.", "PublicationYear": "2020", "Authors": ["Ali Ebrahimpour Boroojeny", "Akash Shrestha", "Ali Sharifi-Zarchi", "Suzanne Renick Gallagher", "S{\\\"u}leyman Cenk Sahinalp", "Hamidreza Chitsaz"], "RelatedTopics": ["Computer Science", "Mathematics"], "References": ["1359ca450cb872257ba6f005558b8ff4f5be3b65", "328edfe24f2e0d0c29efdd7cf7d9333d10a549a4", "70ff05e93f4eaeef4b8b51ba4e11d1c4cdf856ca", "d6fe05d447c3a379b81c4760f10838a370054c8e", "7e1874986cf6433fabf96fff93ef42b60bdc49f8", "ba640c0682b242cb480bb4eb5b934ee6db949269", "4c0bd952d006b355498e90370bdd01e0746d1ad6", "6f7dc83d5a8494d44dc5568c34646a110ed5a2ba", "f7da65e5e249083be84071fd244782720d326b6c", "d87762aa2ef5a259825cf75d5865d7ddf86b7018"], "ReferenceCount": 41, "CitationCount": 4}, {"URL": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/DNA-methylation-regulates-discrimination-of-from-a-Sharifi-Zarchi-Gerovska/3056edcdfb86ec86bb8de369ce0f7fa0fae40e82", "ID": "3056edcdfb86ec86bb8de369ce0f7fa0fae40e82", "Title": "DNA methylation regulates discrimination of enhancers from promoters through a H3K4me1-H3K4me3 seesaw mechanism", "Abstract": "The analysis suggests that CXXC proteins, as readers of non-methylated CpGs would regulate the \u201cseesaw\u201d mechanism that focuses H3K4me3 to unmethylated sites, while being repulsed from H3k4me1 decorated enhancers and CpG island shores. DNA methylation at promoters is largely correlated with inhibition of gene expression. However, the role of DNA methylation at enhancers is not fully understood, although a crosstalk with chromatin marks is expected. Actually, there exist contradictory reports about positive and negative correlations between DNA methylation and H3K4me1, a chromatin hallmark of enhancers. We investigated the relationship between DNA methylation and active chromatin marks through genome-wide correlations, and found anti-correlation between H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 enrichment at low and intermediate DNA methylation loci. We hypothesized \u201cseesaw\u201d dynamics between H3K4me1 and H3K4me3 in the low and intermediate DNA methylation range, in which DNA methylation discriminates between enhancers and promoters, marked by H3K4me1 and H3K4me3, respectively. Low methylated regions are H3K4me3 enriched, while those with intermediate DNA methylation levels are progressively H3K4me1 enriched. Additionally, the enrichment of H3K27ac, distinguishing active from primed enhancers, follows a plateau in the lower range of the intermediate DNA methylation level, corresponding to active enhancers, and decreases linearly in the higher range of the intermediate DNA methylation. Thus, the decrease of the DNA methylation switches smoothly the state of the enhancers from a primed to an active state. We summarize these observations into a rule of thumb of one-out-of-three methylation marks: \u201cIn each genomic region only one out of these three methylation marks {DNA methylation, H3K4me1, H3K4me3} is high. If it is the DNA methylation, the region is inactive. If it is H3K4me1, the region is an enhancer, and if it is H3K4me3, the region is a promoter\u201d. To test our model, we used available genome-wide datasets of H3K4 methyltransferases knockouts. Our analysis suggests that CXXC proteins, as readers of non-methylated CpGs would regulate the \u201cseesaw\u201d mechanism that focuses H3K4me3 to unmethylated sites, while being repulsed from H3K4me1 decorated enhancers and CpG island shores. Our results show that DNA methylation discriminates promoters from enhancers through H3K4me1-H3K4me3 seesaw mechanism, and suggest its possible function in the inheritance of chromatin marks after cell division. Our analyses suggest aberrant formation of promoter-like regions and ectopic transcription of hypomethylated regions of DNA.

Objective The extracellular matrix (ECM) of the cumulus oocyte complex (COC) is composed of several molecules that have different roles during follicle development. This study aims to explore gene expression profiles for ECM and cell adhesion molecules in the cumulus cells of polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients based on their insulin sensitivity following controlled ovarian stimulation (COS). Materials and Methods In this prospective case-control study enrolled 23 women less than 36 years of age who participated in an intracytoplasmic sperm injection (ICSI) program. Patients were subdivided into 3 groups: control (n=8, fertile women with male infertility history), insulin resistant (IR) PCOS (n=7), and insulin sensitive (IS) PCOS (n=8). We compared 84 ECM component and adhesion molecule gene expressions by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction array (qPCR-array) among the groups. Results We noted that 21 of the 84 studied genes differentially expressed among the groups, from which 18 of these genes downregulated. Overall, comparison of PCOS cases with controls showed downregulation of extracellular matrix protein 1 (ECM1); catenin (cadherin-associated protein), alpha 1 (CTNNA1); integrin, alpha 5 (ITGA5); laminin, alpha 3 (LAMA3); laminin, beta 1 (LAMB1); fibronectin 1 (FN1); and integrin, alpha 7 (ITGA7). In the IS group, there was upregulation of ADAM metallopeptidase with thrombospondin type 1 motif, 8 (ADAMTS8) and neural cell adhesion molecule 1 (NCAM1) compared with the controls (P&lt;0.05). Conclusion Downregulation of ECM and cell adhesion molecules seem to be related to PCOS. Gene expression profile alterations in cumulus cells from both the IS and IR groups of PCOS patients seems to be involved in the composition and regulation of ECM during the ovulation process.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells are self-renewing cells that maintain pluripotency to differentiate into all types of cells. Because of their potential to provide a variety of tissues for use in regenerative medicine, there is great interest in the identification of growth factors that govern these unique properties of ES cells. However, the signaling pathways controlling ES cell proliferation remain largely unknown. Since transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) superfamily members have been implicated in the processes of early embryogenesis, we investigated their roles in ES cell self-renewal. Inhibition of activin-Nodal-TGF\u03b2 signaling by Smad7 or SB-431542 dramatically decreased ES cell proliferation without decreasing ES pluripotency. By contrast, inhibition of bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) signaling by Smad6 did not exhibit such effects, suggesting that activin-Nodal-TGF\u03b2 signaling, but not BMP signaling, is indispensable for ES cell propagation. In serum-free culture, supplementation of recombinant activin or Nodal, but not TGF\u03b2 or BMP, significantly enhanced ES cell propagation without affecting pluripotency. We also found that activin-Nodal signaling was constitutively activated in an autocrine fashion in serum-free cultured ES cells, and that inhibition of such endogenous signaling by SB-431542 decreased ES cell propagation in serum-free conditions.

In the three decades since pluripotent mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were first described they have been derived and maintained by using various empirical combinations of feeder cells, conditioned media, cytokines, growth factors, hormones, fetal calf serum, and serum extracts. Consequently ES-cell self-renewal is generally considered to be dependent on multifactorial stimulation of dedicated transcriptional circuitries, pre-eminent among which is the activation of STAT3 by cytokines (ref. 8). Here we show, however, that extrinsic stimuli are dispensable for the derivation, propagation and pluripotency of ES cells. Self-renewal is enabled by the elimination of differentiation-inducing signalling from mitogen-activated protein kinase. Additional inhibition of glycogen synthase kinase 3 consolidates biosynthetic capacity and suppresses residual differentiation. Complete bypass of cytokine signalling is confirmed by isolating ES cells genetically devoid of STAT3. These findings reveal that ES cells have an innate programme for self-replication that does not require extrinsic instruction. This property may account for their latent tumorigenicity. The delineation of minimal requirements for self-renewal now provides a defined platform for the precise description and dissection of the pluripotent state.", "PublicationYear": "2008", "Authors": ["Qi-Long Ying", "Jason P.

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) herald tremendous promise for the production of clinically useful cell types for the treatment of injury and disease. Numerous reports demonstrate their differentiation into definitive endoderm (DE) cells, the germ layer from which pancreatic \u03b2 cells and hepatocytes arise, solely from exposure to a high dose of recombinant Activin/Nodal. We show that combining a second related ligand, BMP4, in combination with Activin A yields 15%\u201320% more DE as compared with Activin A alone. The addition of recombinant BMP4 accelerates the downregulation of pluripotency genes, particularly SOX2, and results in upregulation of endogenous BMP2 and BMP4, which in turn leads to elevated levels of phospho\u2010SMAD1/5/8. Combined Activin A and BMP4 treatment also leads to an increase in the expression of DE genes CXCR4, SOX17, and FOXA2 when compared with Activin A addition alone. Comparative microarray studies between DE cells harvested on day 3 of differentiation further reveal a novel set of genes upregulated in response to initial BMP4 exposure. Several of these, including APLNR, LRIG3, MCC, LEPREL1, ROR2, and LZTS1, are expressed in the mouse primitive streak, the site of DE formation. Thus, this synergism between Activin A and BMP4 during the in vitro differentiation of hESC into DE suggests a complex interplay between BMP and Activin/Nodal signaling during the in vivo allocation and expansion of the endoderm lineage.

Human ESCs (hESCs) respond to signals that determine their pluripotency, proliferation, survival, and differentiation status. In this report, we demonstrate that phosphatidylinositol 3\u2010kinase (PI3K) antagonizes the ability of hESCs to differentiate in response to transforming growth factor \u03b2 family members such as Activin A and Nodal. Inhibition of PI3K signaling efficiently promotes differentiation of hESCs into mesendoderm and then definitive endoderm (DE) by allowing them to be specified by Activin/Nodal signals present in hESC cultures. Under conditions where hESCs are grown in mouse embryo fibroblast\u2010conditioned medium under feeder\u2010free conditions, \u223c70%\u201380% are converted into DE following 5 days of treatment with inhibitors of the PI3K pathway, such as LY 294002 and AKT1\u2010II. Microarray and quantitative polymerase chain reaction\u2010based gene expression profiling demonstrates that definitive endoderm formation under these conditions closely parallels that following specification with elevated Activin A and low fetal calf serum (FCS)/knockout serum replacement (KSR). Reduced insulin/insulin\u2010like growth factor (IGF) signaling was found to be critical for cell fate commitment into DE. Levels of insulin/IGF present in FCS/KSR, normally used to promote self\u2010renewal of hESCs, antagonized differentiation. In summary, we show that generation of hESC\u2010DE requires two conditions: signaling by Activin/Nodal family members and release from inhibitory signals generated by PI3K through insulin/IGF.

Human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) have enormous potential as a source of cells for cell replacement therapies and as a model for early human development. In this study we examined the differentiating potential of hESCs into hepatocytes in two- and three-dimensional (2D and 3D) culture systems. Embryoid bodies (EBs) were inserted into a collagen scaffold 3D culture system or cultured on collagen-coated dishes and stimulated with exogenous growth factors to induce hepatic histogenesis. Immunofluorescence analysis revealed the expression of albumin (ALB) and cytokeratin-18 (CK-18). The differentiated cells in 2D and 3D culture system displayed several characteristics of hepatocytes, including expression of transthyretin, alpha-1-antitrypsin, cytokeratin 8, 18, 19, tryptophan-2,3-dioxygenase, tyrosine aminotransferase, glucose-6-phosphatase (G6P), cytochrome P450 subunits 7a1 and secretion of alpha-fetoprotein (AFP) and ALB and production of urea. In 3D culture, ALB and G6P were detected earlier and higher levels of urea and AFP were produced, when compared with 2D culture. Electron microscopy of differentiated hESCs showed hepatocyte-like ultrastructure, including glycogon granules, well-developed Golgi apparatuses, rough and smooth endoplasmic reticuli and intercellular canaliculi. The differentiation of hESCs into hepatocyte-like cells within 3D collagen scaffolds containing exogenous growth factors, gives rise to cells displaying morphological features, gene expression patterns and metabolic activities characteristic of hepatocytes and may provide a source of differentiated cells for treatment of liver diseases.", "PublicationYear": "2006", "Authors": ["Hossein Baharvand", "Seyed Mahmoud Hashemi", "Saeid Kazemi Ashtiani", "Alireza Farrokhi"], "RelatedTopics": ["Medicine", "Biology"], "References": ["f483079d72c08834399599e9b86098a5dd5e3d75", "bc51f0525db4659460f7803eaf6d4aea5f8d73b7", "d20657c47f3a1b7f471b6984ea3ae61a532b4a40", "cac088b1025b955cb755d41bbf28914d4c972b45", "a52a588e82bedb1131463621691944e3e4a67040", "24f1b31fa2d8b3fe2e05bbb6dfef6d05a32aacd9", "bb6b34d7637bc56272bf3d450f7a1c305cec1156", "a8fd783e713650157be6d2025c9a02afa76daf88", "39744de41cc1831534480f2e6db0476bbdaf695b", "3499912a25bb7fb86ee8331687a66349bc8f90cc"], "ReferenceCount": 27, "CitationCount": 420}, {"URL": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Differentiation-of-Embryonic-Stem-Cells-to-Relevant-Murry-Keller/1ba595d2d3531f5d9bbcbeeefc7af7f1e0365855", "ID": "1ba595d2d3531f5d9bbcbeeefc7af7f1e0365855", "Title": "Differentiation of Embryonic Stem Cells to Clinically Relevant Populations: Lessons from Embryonic Development", "Abstract": "Semantic Scholar extracted view of \\\"Differentiation of Embryonic Stem Cells to Clinically Relevant Populations: Lessons from Embryonic Development\\\" by C.

An essential step in this schema is the generation of pancreatic progenitors--cells that express Pdx1 and produce all the cell types of the pancreas. High-content chemical screening identified a small molecule, (-)-indolactam V, that induces differentiation of a substantial number of Pdx1-expressing cells from human ESCs. The Pdx1-expressing cells express other pancreatic markers and contribute to endocrine, exocrine and duct cells, in vitro and in vivo. Further analyses showed that (-)-indolactam V works specifically at one stage of pancreatic development, inducing pancreatic progenitors from definitive endoderm.

Graph kernels based on walks, subtrees and cycles in graphs have been proposed so far. As a general problem, these kernels are either computationally expensive or limited in their expressiveness. We try to overcome this problem by defining expressive graph kernels which are based on paths. As the computation of all paths and longest paths in a graph is NP-hard, we propose graph kernels based on shortest paths.

(2006) yet provably positive semi-definite is provided. We present a unified framework to study graph kernels, special cases of which include the random walk (Gartner et al., 2003; Borgwardt et al., 2005) and marginalized (Kashima et al., 2003, 2004; Mahet al., 2004) graph kernels. Through reduction to a Sylvester equation we improve the time complexity of kernel computation between unlabeled graphs with n vertices from O(n6) to O(n3). We find a spectral decomposition approach even more efficient when computing entire kernel matrices. For labeled graphs we develop conjugate gradient and fixed-point methods that take O(dn3) time per iteration, where d is the size of the label set. By extending the necessary linear algebra to Reproducing Kernel Hilbert Spaces (RKHS) we obtain the same result for d-dimensional edge kernels, and O(n4) in the infinite-dimensional case; on sparse graphs these algorithms only take O(n2) time per iteration in all cases. Experiments on graphs from bioinformatics and other application domains show that these techniques can speed up computation of the kernel by an order of magnitude or more. We also show that certain rational kernels (Cortes et al., 2002, 2003, 2004) when specialized to graphs reduce to our random walk graph kernel. Finally, we relate our framework to R-convolution kernels (Haussler, 1999) and provide a kernel that is close to the optimal assignment kernel of kernel of Frohlich et al.

Motivation: Sequence assembly is a difficult problem whose importance has grown again recently as the cost of sequencing has dramatically dropped. Most new sequence assembly software has started by building a de Bruijn graph, avoiding the overlap-based methods used previously because of the computational cost and complexity of these with very large numbers of short reads. Here, we show how to use suffix array-based methods that have formed the basis of recent very fast sequence mapping algorithms to find overlaps and generate assembly string graphs asymptotically faster than previously described algorithms. Results: Standard overlap assembly methods have time complexity O(N2), where N is the sum of the lengths of the reads. We use the Ferragina\u2013Manzini index (FM-index) derived from the Burrows\u2013Wheeler transform to find overlaps of length at least \u03c4 among a set of reads. As well as an approach that finds all overlaps then implements transitive reduction to produce a string graph, we show how to output directly only the irreducible overlaps, significantly shrinking memory requirements and reducing compute time to O(N), independent of depth. Overlap-based assembly methods naturally handle mixed length read sets, including capillary reads or long reads promised by the third generation sequencing technologies. The algorithms we present here pave the way for overlap-based assembly approaches to be developed that scale to whole vertebrate genome de novo assembly.

We introduce propagation kernels, a general graph-kernel framework for efficiently measuring the similarity of structured data. Propagation kernels are based on monitoring how information spreads through a set of given graphs. They leverage early-stage distributions from propagation schemes such as random walks to capture structural information encoded in node labels, attributes, and edge information. This has two benefits. First, off-the-shelf propagation schemes can be used to naturally construct kernels for many graph types, including labeled, partially labeled, unlabeled, directed, and attributed graphs. Second, by leveraging existing efficient and informative propagation schemes, propagation kernels can be considerably faster than state-of-the-art approaches without sacrificing predictive performance. We will also show that if the graphs at hand have a regular structure, for instance when modeling image or video data, one can exploit this regularity to scale the kernel computation to large databases of graphs with thousands of nodes.

ABSTRACT Histone lysine methylation and CpG DNA methylation contribute to transcriptional regulation. We have shown previously that dimethylated and trimethylated forms of histone H3 at lysine 4 (H3K4me2 and H3K4me3) are primarily depleted from CpG-methylated DNA regions by using patch-methylated stable episomes (minichromosomes) in human cells. This effect on H3K4me2 is clearly not linked to the transcriptional activity in the methylated DNA region; however, transcriptional activity may play a role in the presence of H3K4me3. Here, we present clear evidence of the impact of transcriptional activity on the overall level of H3K4me3 in the coding region and the lack of impact on H3K4me2. Our data also demonstrate the influence of transcriptional activity on the distribution of H3K4me3 and H3K4me2, but not that of total H3, in the 5\u2032 end of the coding region relative to the 3\u2032 end.

BackgroundPluripotency of embryonic stem (ES) cells is controlled in part by chromatin-modifying factors that regulate histone H3 lysine 4 (H3K4) methylation.

BackgroundDNA methylation and the Polycomb repression system are epigenetic mechanisms that play important roles in maintaining transcriptional repression. Recent evidence suggests that DNA methylation can attenuate the binding of Polycomb protein components to chromatin and thus plays a role in determining their genomic targeting. However, whether this role of DNA methylation is important in the context of transcriptional regulation is unclear.ResultsBy genome-wide mapping of the Polycomb Repressive Complex 2-signature histone mark, H3K27me3, in severely DNA hypomethylated mouse somatic cells, we show that hypomethylation leads to widespread H3K27me3 redistribution, in a manner that reflects the local DNA methylation status in wild-type cells. Unexpectedly, we observe striking loss of H3K27me3 and Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 from Polycomb target gene promoters in DNA hypomethylated cells, including Hox gene clusters. Importantly, we show that many of these genes become ectopically expressed in DNA hypomethylated cells, consistent with loss of Polycomb-mediated repression.ConclusionsAn intact DNA methylome is required for appropriate Polycomb-mediated gene repression by constraining Polycomb Repressive Complex 2 targeting.

We find CpG-poor promoters hypermethylated in somatic cells, which does not preclude their activity. This methylation is present in male gametes and results in evolutionary loss of CpG dinucleotides, as measured by divergence between humans and primates.

The known DNA methylation/unmethylation mechanisms are sequence unspecific, but different cells with the same genome have different methylomes. Thus, additional processes bringing specificity to the methylation/unmethylation mechanisms are required. Searching for such processes, we demonstrated that CpG methylation states are influenced by the sequence context surrounding the CpGs.

The newly discovered motifs reveal \u201cmethylation/unmethylation factors\u201d that could recruit the \u201cmethylation/unmethylation machinery\u201d to the loci specified by the motifs. Our methylation motif discovery algorithm provides a synergistic approach to the differently methylated region algorithms.

The motifs that were found discriminate between hypomethylated and hypermethylated regions. The hypomethylation-associated motifs have a high CG content, their targets appear in conserved regions near transcription start sites, they tend to co-occur within transcription factor binding sites, they are involved in breaking the H3K4me3/H3K27me3 bivalent balance, and they transit the enhancers from repressive H3K27me3 to active H3K27ac during ES cell differentiation.

STUDY QUESTION\\nOocyte developmental competence is altered in patients with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS); is gene expression in cumulus cells (CCs) from mature metaphase II oocytes of patients with PCOS altered as well?\\n\\n\\nSUMMARY ANSWER\\nCompared with CCs from non-PCOS patients, the gene expression profile of CCs isolated from mature oocytes of patients with PCOS present alterations that could explain the abnormal folliculogenesis and reduced oocyte competence in such patients.\\n\\n\\nWHAT IS KNOWN ALREADY\\nAbnormal mRNA expression of several members of the insulin-like growth factor (IGF) family in CCs from PCOS patients was previously reported. Moreover, the whole transcriptome has been investigated in cultured CCs from PCOS patients.\\n\\n\\nSTUDY DESIGN, SIZE AND DURATION\\nThis retrospective study included six PCOS patients diagnosed following the Rotterdam Criteria and six non-PCOS patients who all underwent ICSI for male infertility in the assisted reproduction technique (ART) Department of Montpellier University Hospital, between 2009 and 2011.\\n\\n\\nPARTICIPANTS/MATERIALS, SETTING AND METHODS\\nCCs from PCOS and non-PCOS patients who underwent controlled ovarian stimulation (COS) were isolated mechanically before ICSI. Gene expression profiles were analysed using the microarray technology and the Significance Analysis of Microarray was applied to compare the expression profiles of CCs from PCOS and non-PCOS patients.\\n\\n\\nMAIN RESULTS\\nThe gene expression profile of CCs from patients with PCOS was significantly different from that of CCs from non-PCOS patients. Specifically, CCs from women with PCOS were characterized by abnormal expression of many growth factors, including members of the epidermal growth factor-like (EGFR, EREG and AREG) and IGF-like families (IGF1R, IGF2R, IGF2BP2 and IGFBP2), that are known to play a role in oocyte competence. In addition, mRNA transcripts of factors involved in steroid metabolism, such as CYP11A1, CYP1B1, CYP19A1 and CYP2B7P1, were deregulated in PCOS CCs, and this could explain the abnormal steroidogenesis observed in these women. Functional annotation of the differentially expressed genes suggests that defects in the transforming growth factor \u03b2 and estrogen receptors signalling cascades may contribute to the reduced oocyte developmental competence in patients with PCOS.\\n\\n\\nLIMITATIONS AND REASONS FOR CAUTION\\nOwing to the strict selection criteria (similar age, weight and reasons for ART), this study included a small sample size (six cases and six controls), and thus, further investigations using a large cohort of patients are needed to confirm these results.\\n\\n\\nWIDER IMPLICATIONS OF THE FINDINGS\\nThis study opens a new perspective for understanding the pathogenesis of PCOS.\\n\\n\\nSTUDY FUNDING/COMPETING INTERESTS\\nThis work was partially supported by a grant from the Ferring Pharmaceutical.

BackgroundPolycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) is a common endocrine and metabolic disorder in women. The developmental competence of oocytes and embryos in PCOS patients is reduced to a certain extent (comparing to non-PCOS patients, the high quality embryo rate was decreased by 16% from the data of our centre) during the in vitro fertilization (IVF) process. Cross-talk between the oocyte and cumulus cells is critical for oocyte maturation and embryo competence. In this study, we have evaluated the transcription of specific genes in cumulus cells harvested from pre-ovulatory follicles of PCOS patients before IVF, according to individual oocyte nuclear maturity and developmental competence. Seven genes (RUNX2, PSAT1, ADAMTS9, CXCL1, CXCL2, CXCL3, and ITGB5) were targeted from our previous cDNA microarray data which isolated genes related to oocyte nuclear maturation in PCOS patients. Two additional genes which had been found to be associated with oocyte maturation or embryo quality in non-PCOS patients (GPX3 and PTX3) were also studied.MethodsThe mRNA expression levels of cumulus cells were detected by qRT- PCR.ResultsConsistent with our previous cDNA microarray data, with the exception of GPX3 and PTX3, the selected 7 genes were related to oocyte nuclear maturation in PCOS patients. Noticeably, the expression level of RUNX2 was lower in cumulus cells derived from oocytes that could develop into blastocysts than the level of expression from oocytes that could not. The PTX3 expression level was significantly lower in cumulus cells from oocytes with two normal pronuclei than that from oocytes that formed &gt;2 pronuclei (MPN) after fertilization. GPX3 mRNA levels were decreased in cumulus cells isolated from oocytes that developed into blastocysts with high potential development competence.ConclusionsSeveral cumulus cell genes were associated with oocyte maturation, fertilization and embryo quality in PCOS patients. RUNX2 and GPX3 are candidate genetic markers in the monitoring of embryo quality for PCOS patients, whereas PTX3 mainly played a role in fertilization process. Together with morphological evaluation, cumulus cells genes may serve as biomarkers of oocyte and embryo selection during the IVF process for PCOS patients and may advance our understanding of PCOS.", "PublicationYear": "2013", "Authors": ["Xin Huang", "Cuifang Hao", "Xiaofang Shen", "Yuhua Zhang", "Xiaoyan Liu"], "RelatedTopics": ["Medicine"], "References": ["2ee11c60e43f4733c377d8415573a9ba730d5a08", "9985afbaed2d9690d89bcd2134a9f692cd1a2438", "25854b76ce4313739c5e6abd7e7ad65d9c9ac0f5", "24f0db247e0681696b4177d91a8aa7c0ca307651", "17488344a2c6abb05d2089f8af5b4d5bd412f5f2", "5a6afcc49d57b5b5f0e1aaa563bdd85cef93f66d", "b0ffc6d0307d6f505136e553929be1722bb45ea8", "ffd1dff82e79bcb4c0e2c1ab87982248cc96fdce", "a79649c2a2d4b8bf39088c9dca2671e37938d471", "25bf2b836534239802552d152a396ed88fbc6d27"], "ReferenceCount": 60, "CitationCount": 73}, {"URL": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Associations-Between-Insulin-Resistance%2C-Free-Fatty-Niu-Lin/a947c55e48e4361cf60a02fb5d91b09704b09bd6", "ID": "a947c55e48e4361cf60a02fb5d91b09704b09bd6", "Title": "Associations Between Insulin Resistance, Free Fatty Acids, and Oocyte Quality in Polycystic Ovary Syndrome During In Vitro Fertilization", "Abstract": "The results indicated that developmental competence is associated with oleic and stearic acid concentrations, which may contribute to the poor pregnancy outcomes in patients with PCOS. Context: Both polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) and obesity are associated with specific reproductive health complications, including lower oocyte quality and clinical pregnancy rates in assisted conception cycles, which may be a result of metabolism-induced changes in the oocyte through the microenvironment of follicular fluid. Free fatty acids (FFAs) are important biomedical indicators of abnormal lipid metabolism and have pronounced effects on cells, leading to changes in metabolism, cell growth, and differentiation Objective: Our objective was to determine the effect of FFA metabolism in plasma and follicular fluid on oocyte quality in the women with PCOS undergoing in vitro fertilization. Design and Setting: Ninety-three women undergoing in vitro fertilization treatment, including 55 with PCOS and 38 age-matched controls, were recruited. PCOS patients were divided into obese and nonobese subgroups on the basis of their body mass index. Main Outcome Measures: Embryo quality was morphologically assessed, and serum sex hormone and insulin levels were measured. FFAs in plasma and follicular fluid were measured using gas chromatography-mass spectrometry. Results: PCOS was found to be associated with significantly higher LH/FSH, total T, free androgen index (FAI), and lower SHBG levels, independent of obesity(P &lt; .05). Obese women with PCOS had a significantly higher total T level, FAI, fasting insulin, insulin resistance index as determined by homeostasis model assessment for insulin resistance, and lower SHBG levels than the nonobese women with PCOS (P &lt; .05). The embryo fragmentation score was significantly positively correlated with the oleic acid concentration in all PCOS patients (r = 0.22, P = .04, for nonobese patients and r = 0.25, P = .03, for obese patients). Conclusions: Our findings clearly demonstrated that PCOS is associated with significantly higher FAI and insulin resistance levels and decreased plasma SHBG levels, independent of body mass index. Obese PCOS patients had higher palmitoleic acid and oleic acid levels in both the plasma and follicular fluid than did the control subject and nonobese PCOS patients.

Differential gene expression profiles were classified by post-analyses of microarray data, followed by western blot analyses to confirm the microarray data of selected genes. In total, 243 genes were differentially expressed (125 upregulated and 118 downregulated) between the PCOS and non-PCOS granulosa cells. These genes are involved in reproductive system development, amino acid metabolism and cellular development and proliferation. Comparative analysis revealed genes involved in the mitogen-activated protein kinase/extracellular regulated kinase (MAPK/ERK) signaling pathways.

The aim of this work was to study gene expression patterns of cultured cumulus cells from lean and overweight-obese polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS) patients using genome-wide oligonucleotide microarray. The study included 25 patients undergoing in vitro fertilization and intra-cytoplasmic sperm injection: 12 diagnosed with PCOS and 13 matching controls. Each of the groups was subdivided into lean (body mass index (BMI) &lt; 24) and overweight (BMI &gt; 27) subgroups. The following comparisons of gene expression data were made: lean PCOS versus lean controls, lean PCOS versus overweight PCOS, all PCOS versus all controls, overweight PCOS versus overweight controls, overweight controls versus lean controls and all overweight versus all lean. The largest number of differentially expressed genes (DEGs), with fold change (FC) |FC| &gt;or= 1.5 and P-value &lt; 0.01, was found in the lean PCOS versus lean controls comparison (487) with most of these genes being down-regulated in PCOS. The second largest group of DEGs originated from the comparison of lean PCOS versus overweight PCOS (305). The other comparisons resulted in a much smaller number of DEGs (174, 109, 125 and 12, respectively). In the comparison of lean PCOS with lean controls, most DEGs were transcription factors and components of the extracellular matrix and two pathways, Wnt/beta-catenin and mitogen-activated protein kinase. When comparing overweight PCOS with overweight controls, most DEGs were of pathways related to insulin signaling, metabolism and energy production.

Members of the transforming growth factor-beta superfamily, including bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP-4), have been implicated as regulators of neuronal and glial differentiation. To test for a possible role of BMP-4 in early mammalian neural specification, we examined its effect on neurogenesis in aggregate cultures of mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells. Compared to control aggregates, in which up to 20% of the cells acquired immunoreactivity for the neuron-specific antibody TuJ1, aggregates maintained for 8 days in serum-free medium containing BMP-4 generated 5- to 10-fold fewer neurons. The action of BMP-4 was dose dependent and restricted to the fifth through eighth day in suspension. In addition to the reduction in neurons, we observed that ES cell cultures exposed to BMP-4 contained fewer cells that were immunoreactive for glial fibrillary acidic protein or the HNK-1 neural antigen. Furthermore, under phase contrast, cultures prepared from BMP-4-treated aggregates contained a significant proportion of nonneuronal cells with a characteristic flat, elongated morphology. These cells were immunoreactive for antibodies to the intermediate filament protein vimentin; they were rare or absent in control cultures. Treatment with BMP-4 enhanced the expression of the early mesodermal genes brachyury and tbx6 but had relatively little effect on total cell number or cell death. Coapplication of the BMP-4 antagonist noggin counteracted the effect of exogenous BMP-4, but noggin alone had no effect on neuralization in either the absence or presence of retinoids. Collectively, our results suggest that BMP-4 can overcome the neuralizing action of retinoic acid to enhance mesodermal differentiation of murine ES cells.", "PublicationYear": "1999", "Authors": ["Michael F.

We have shown previously that they lack type-II binding receptors (T beta RII) and in this respect resemble the inner cell mass and ectoderm cells of mouse embryos 4.5-7.5 days post coitum (dpc); they do however express type-I (alk-5) signalling receptors. Here we show that in contrast to several tumour cell lines, stable transfection of wtT beta RII is not sufficient for ES cells to become biologically sensitive to TGF beta. We analysed the expression of several down-stream molecules known to be involved in TGF beta signalling (Smads) and TGF beta-mediated cell cycle regulation (cyclins D) during the differentiation of control and wtT beta RII-expressing ES cells and showed that upregulation of these molecules correlated with (i) an increase in plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 (PAI-1) synthesis and (ii) growth inhibition, following addition of TGF beta 1. These TGF beta responses were reduced in an ES cell line expressing a dominant negative (truncated) T beta RII (delta T beta RII). The differentiation pattern of control and wtT beta RII-expressing ES cells was indistinguishable in monolayer culture and as embryoid bodies, but in delta T beta RII ES cells, the capacity to form mesodermal derivatives in monolayer cultures in response to the addition of retinoic acid (RA) and removal of leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) was lost, and only endoderm-like cells formed. The T beta RII and delta T beta RII ES cells were, however, both distinguishable from control ES cells when allowed to differentiate in chimaeric embryos following aggregation with morula-stage hosts. Conceptuses containing mutant cells, recovered from pseudopregnant females at the equivalent of 9.5 dpc, exhibited highly defective yolk sac development; most strikingly, no blood vessels were present and in addition the yolk sacs with derivatives of ES cells containing wtT beta RII were blistered and lacked haematopoietic cells.

The propagation of embryonic stem (ES) cells in an undifferentiated pluripotent state is dependent on leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF) or related cytokines. These factors act through receptor complexes containing the signal transducer gp130. The downstream mechanisms that lead to ES cell self-renewal have not been delineated, however. In this study, chimeric receptors were introduced into ES cells. Biochemical and functional studies of transfected cells demonstrated a requirement for engagement and activation of the latent trancription factor STAT3. Detailed mutational analyses unexpectedly revealed that the four STAT3 docking sites in gp130 are not functionally equivalent. The role of STAT3 was then investigated using the dominant interfering mutant, STAT3F. ES cells that expressed this molecule constitutively could not be isolated. An episomal supertransfection strategy was therefore used to enable the consequences of STAT3F expression to be examined. In addition, an inducible STAT3F transgene was generated. In both cases, expression of STAT3F in ES cells growing in the presence of LIF specifically abrogated self-renewal and promoted differentiation. These complementary approaches establish that STAT3 plays a central role in the maintenance of the pluripotential stem cell phenotype. This contrasts with the involvement of STAT3 in the induction of differentiation in somatic cell types. Cell type-specific interpretation of STAT3 activation thus appears to be pivotal to the diverse developmental effects of the LIF family of cytokines.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells can be derived and propagated from multiple strains of mouse and rat through application of small-molecule inhibitors of the fibroblast growth factor (FGF)/Erk pathway and of glycogen synthase kinase 3. These conditions shield pluripotent cells from differentiation-inducing stimuli. We investigate the effect of these inhibitors on the development of pluripotent epiblast in intact pre-implantation embryos. We find that blockade of Erk signalling from the 8-cell stage does not impede blastocyst formation but suppresses development of the hypoblast. The size of the inner cell mass (ICM) compartment is not reduced, however. Throughout the ICM, the epiblast-specific marker Nanog is expressed, and in XX embryos epigenetic silencing of the paternal X chromosome is erased. Epiblast identity and pluripotency were confirmed by contribution to chimaeras with germline transmission. These observations indicate that segregation of hypoblast from the bipotent ICM is dependent on FGF/Erk signalling and that in the absence of this signal, the entire ICM can acquire pluripotency. Furthermore, the epiblast does not require paracrine support from the hypoblast. Thus, nai\u0308ve epiblast and ES cells are in a similar ground state, with an autonomous capacity for survival and replication, and high vulnerability to Erk signalling.

A central challenge in embryonic stem (ES) cell biology is to understand how to impose direction on primary lineage commitment. In basal culture conditions, the majority of ES cells convert asynchronously into neural cells. However, many cells resist differentiation and others adopt nonneural fates. Mosaic activation of the neural reporter Sox-green fluorescent protein suggests regulation by cell-cell interactions. We detected expression of Notch receptors and ligands in mouse ES cells and investigated the role of this pathway. Genetic manipulation to activate Notch constitutively does not alter the stem cell phenotype. However, upon withdrawal of self-renewal stimuli, differentiation is directed rapidly and exclusively into the neural lineage. Conversely, pharmacological or genetic interference with Notch signalling suppresses the neural fate choice. Notch promotion of neural commitment requires parallel signalling through the fibroblast growth factor receptor. Stromal cells expressing Notch ligand stimulate neural specification of human ES cells, indicating that this is a conserved pathway in pluripotent stem cells. These findings define an unexpected and decisive role for Notch in ES cell fate determination. Limiting activation of endogenous Notch results in heterogeneous lineage commitment.

Human and mouse embryonic stem cells (HESCs and MESCs, respectively) self-renew indefinitely while maintaining the ability to generate all three germ-layer derivatives. Despite the importance of ESCs in developmental biology and their potential impact on tissue replacement therapy, the molecular mechanism underlying ESC self-renewal is poorly understood. Here we show that activation of the canonical Wnt pathway is sufficient to maintain self-renewal of both HESCs and MESCs. Although Stat-3 signaling is involved in MESC self-renewal, stimulation of this pathway does not support self-renewal of HESCs. Instead we find that Wnt pathway activation by 6-bromoindirubin-3\u2032-oxime (BIO), a specific pharmacological inhibitor of glycogen synthase kinase-3 (GSK-3), maintains the undifferentiated phenotype in both types of ESCs and sustains expression of the pluripotent state-specific transcription factors Oct-3/4, Rex-1 and Nanog. Wnt signaling is endogenously activated in undifferentiated MESCs and is downregulated upon differentiation. In addition, BIO-mediated Wnt activation is functionally reversible, as withdrawal of the compound leads to normal multidifferentiation programs in both HESCs and MESCs.

Pluripotent stem cells derived from preimplantation embryos, primordial germ cells or teratocarcinomas are currently unique in undergoing prolonged symmetrical self-renewal in culture. For mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells, self-renewal is dependent on signals from the cytokine leukaemia inhibitory factor (LIF) and from either serum or bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs). In addition to the extrinsic regulation of gene expression, intrinsic transcriptional determinants are also required for maintenance of the undifferentiated state. These include Oct4, a member of the POU family of homeodomain proteins and a second recently identified homeodomain protein, Nanog. When overexpressed, Nanog allows ES cells to self-renew in the absence of the otherwise obligatory LIF and BMP signals. Although Nanog can act independent of the LIF signal, a contribution of both pathways provides maximal self-renewal efficiency. Nanog function also requires Oct4.

Murine embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cell lines established directly from the early embryo1,2 which can contribute differentiated progeny to all adult tissues, including the germ-cell lineage3, after re-incorporation into the normal embryo. They provide both a cellular vector for the generation of transgenic animals4 and a useful system for the identification of polypeptide factors controlling differentiation processes in early development5. In particular, medium conditioned by Buffalo rat liver cells contains a polypeptide factor, ES cell differentiation inhibitory activity (DIA), which specifically suppresses the spontaneous differentiation of ES cells in vitro, thereby permitting their growth as homogeneous stem cell populations in the absence of heterologous feeder cells6. ES cell pluripotentiality, including the ability to give rise to functional gametes, is preserved after prolonged culture in Buffalo rat liver media as a source of DIA7. Here, we report that purified DIA is related in structure and function to the recently identified haemopoetic regulatory factors human interleukin for DA cells8,9 and leukaemia inhibitory factor10.

Signalling molecules activated downstream of gp130 in ES cells include STAT3, the protein tyrosine phosphatase SHP-2, and the mitogen-activated protein kinases, ERK1 and ERK2. A chimaeric receptor in which tyrosine 118 in the gp130 cytoplasmic domain was mutated did not engage SHP-2 and failed to activate ERKs. However, this receptor did support ES cell self-renewal. In fact, stem cell colonies formed at 100-fold lower concentrations of cytokine than the unmodified receptor. Moreover, altered ES cell morphology and growth were observed at high cytokine concentrations. These indications of deregulated signalling in the absence of tyrosine 118 were substantiated by sustained activation of STAT3. Confirmation that ERK activation is not required for self-renewal was obtained by propagation of pluripotent ES cells in the presence of the MEK inhibitor PD098059. In fact, the growth of undifferentiated ES cells was enhanced by culture in PD098059. Thus activation of ERKs appears actively to impair self-renewal.

Induced pluripotent stem cells (iPSCs) have been derived at low frequencies from different cell types through ectopic expression of the transcription factors Oct4 and Sox2, combined with either Klf4 and c-Myc or Lin28 and Nanog. In order to generate iPSCs more effectively, it will be crucial to identify somatic cells that are easily accessible and possibly require fewer factors for conversion into iPSCs. Here, we show that both human and mouse melanocytes give rise to iPSCs at higher efficiencies than fibroblasts. Moreover, we demonstrate that a mouse malignant melanoma cell line, which has previously been reprogrammed into embryonic stem cells by nuclear transfer, remains equally amenable to reprogramming into iPSCs by these transcription factors. In contrast to skin fibroblasts, melanocytes and melanoma cells did not require ectopic Sox2 expression for conversion into iPSCs. iPSC lines from melanocytic cells expressed pluripotency markers, formed teratomas and contributed to viable chimeric mice with germ line transmission.

The efficiency of this process, however, is low. Pluripotency can be induced without c-Myc, but with even lower efficiency. A p53 (also known as TP53 in humans and Trp53 in mice) short-interfering RNA (siRNA) was recently shown to promote human iPS cell generation, but the specificity and mechanisms remain to be determined. Here we report that up to 10% of transduced mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking p53 became iPS cells, even without the Myc retrovirus. The p53 deletion also promoted the induction of integration-free mouse iPS cells with plasmid transfection. Furthermore, in the p53-null background, iPS cells were generated from terminally differentiated T lymphocytes. The suppression of p53 also increased the efficiency of human iPS cell generation.

The pluripotent status of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) confers upon them the capacity to differentiate into the three primary germ layers, ectoderm, mesoderm and endoderm, from which all the cells of the adult body are derived. An understanding of the mechanisms controlling pluripotency is thus essential for driving the differentiation of human pluripotent cells into cell types useful for clinical applications. The Activin/Nodal signalling pathway is necessary to maintain pluripotency in human ESCs and in mouse epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs), but the molecular mechanisms by which it achieves this effect remain obscure. Here, we demonstrate that Activin/Nodal signalling controls expression of the key pluripotency factor Nanog in human ESCs and in mouse EpiSCs. Nanog in turn prevents neuroectoderm differentiation induced by FGF signalling and limits the transcriptional activity of the Smad2/3 cascade, blocking progression along the endoderm lineage.

Reprogramming of somatic cells to pluripotency, thereby creating induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells, promises to transform regenerative medicine. Most instances of direct reprogramming have been achieved by forced expression of defined factors using multiple viral vectors. However, such iPS cells contain a large number of viral vector integrations, any one of which could cause unpredictable genetic dysfunction. Whereas c-Myc is dispensable for reprogramming, complete elimination of the other exogenous factors is also desired because ectopic expression of either Oct4 (also known as Pou5f1) or Klf4 can induce dysplasia. Two transient transfection-reprogramming methods have been published to address this issue. However, the efficiency of both approaches is extremely low, and neither has been applied successfully to human cells so far. Here we show that non-viral transfection of a single multiprotein expression vector, which comprises the coding sequences of c-Myc, Klf4, Oct4 and Sox2 linked with 2A peptides, can reprogram both mouse and human fibroblasts. Moreover, the transgene can be removed once reprogramming has been achieved. iPS cells produced with this non-viral vector show robust expression of pluripotency markers, indicating a reprogrammed state confirmed functionally by in vitro differentiation assays and formation of adult chimaeric mice. When the single-vector reprogramming system was combined with a piggyBac transposon, we succeeded in establishing reprogrammed human cell lines from embryonic fibroblasts with robust expression of pluripotency markers.

The dominant effect of transcription factors in imparting expanded potency is best exemplified by the reprogramming of fibroblasts to pluripotent cells using retrovirus-mediated transduction of defined transcription factors. In the murine system, Oct4, Sox2, c-Myc and Klf4 are sufficient to convert fibroblasts to induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells that have many characteristics of embryonic stem (ES) cells.

Esrrb-reprogrammed cells share similar expression and epigenetic signatures as ES cells. These cells are also pluripotent and can differentiate in vitro and in vivo into the three major embryonic cell lineages. Furthermore, these cells contribute to mouse chimaeras and are germline transmissible. In ES cells, Esrrb targets many genes involved in self-renewal and pluripotency.

Differentiated cells can be reprogrammed through the formation of heterokaryons and hybrid cells when fused with embryonic stem (ES) cells. Here, we provide evidence that conversion of human B-lymphocytes towards a multipotent state is initiated much more rapidly than previously thought, occurring in transient heterokaryons before nuclear fusion and cell division. Interestingly, reprogramming of human lymphocytes by mouse ES cells elicits the expression of a human ES-specific gene profile, in which markers of human ES cells are expressed (hSSEA4, hFGF receptors and ligands), but markers that are specific to mouse ES cells are not (e.g., Bmp4 and LIF receptor). Using genetically engineered mouse ES cells, we demonstrate that successful reprogramming of human lymphocytes is independent of Sox2, a factor thought to be required for induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. In contrast, there is a distinct requirement for Oct4 in the establishment but not the maintenance of the reprogrammed state. Experimental heterokaryons, therefore, offer a powerful approach to trace the contribution of individual factors to the reprogramming of human somatic cells towards a multipotent state.", "PublicationYear": "2008", "Authors": ["Carlos-Filipe Pereira", "R{\\'e}mi Terranova", "Natalie K.

Expression of the transcription factors Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c\u2010Myc in mesodermal and endodermal derivatives, including fibroblasts, lymphocytes, liver, stomach, and \u03b2 cells, generates induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells. It remains unknown, however, whether cell types of the ectodermal lineage are equally amenable to reprogramming into iPS cells by the same combination of factors. To test this, we have isolated genetically marked neural progenitor cells (NPCs) from neonatal mouse brains and infected them with viral vectors expressing Oct4, Sox2, Klf4, and c\u2010Myc. Infected NPCs gave rise to iPS cells that expressed markers of embryonic stem cells, showed demethylation of pluripotency genes, formed teratomas, and contributed to viable chimeras. In contrast to other somatic cell types, NPCs expressed high levels of endogenous Sox2 and thus did not require viral Sox2 expression for reprogramming into iPS cells. Our data show that in addition to mesoderm\u2010 and endoderm\u2010derived cell types, neural progenitor cells of the ectodermal lineage can be reprogrammed into iPS cells, suggesting that in vitro reprogramming is a universal process.

Epigenetic genome modifications are thought to be important for specifying the lineage and developmental stage of cells within a multicellular organism. Here, we show that the epigenetic profile of pluripotent embryonic stem cells (ES) is distinct from that of embryonic carcinoma cells, haematopoietic stem cells (HSC) and their differentiated progeny. Silent, lineage-specific genes replicated earlier in pluripotent cells than in tissue-specific stem cells or differentiated cells and had unexpectedly high levels of acetylated H3K9 and methylated H3K4. Unusually, in ES cells these markers of open chromatin were also combined with H3K27 trimethylation at some non-expressed genes. Thus, pluripotency of ES cells is characterized by a specific epigenetic profile where lineage-specific genes may be accessible but, if so, carry repressive H3K27 trimethylation modifications. H3K27 methylation is functionally important for preventing expression of these genes in ES cells as premature expression occurs in embryonic ectoderm development (Eed)-deficient ES cells.

Human and mouse embryonic stem cells (ESCs) are derived from blastocyst-stage embryos but have very different biological properties, and molecular analyses suggest that the pluripotent state of human ESCs isolated so far corresponds to that of mouse-derived epiblast stem cells (EpiSCs). Here we rewire the identity of conventional human ESCs into a more immature state that extensively shares defining features with pluripotent mouse ESCs. This was achieved by ectopic induction of Oct4, Klf4, and Klf2 factors combined with LIF and inhibitors of glycogen synthase kinase 3\u03b2 (GSK3\u03b2) and mitogen-activated protein kinase (ERK1/2) pathway. Forskolin, a protein kinase A pathway agonist which can induce Klf4 and Klf2 expression, transiently substitutes for the requirement for ectopic transgene expression. In contrast to conventional human ESCs, these epigenetically converted cells have growth properties, an X-chromosome activation state (XaXa), a gene expression profile, and a signaling pathway dependence that are highly similar to those of mouse ESCs. Finally, the same growth conditions allow the derivation of human induced pluripotent stem (iPS) cells with similar properties as mouse iPS cells.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells derived from early mammalian embryos. Their immortality and rapid growth make them attractive sources for stem cell therapies; however, they produce tumours (teratomas) when transplanted, which could preclude their therapeutic usage. Why ES cells, which lack chromosomal abnormalities, possess tumour-like properties is largely unknown. Here we show that mouse ES cells specifically express a Ras-like gene, which we have named ERas. We show that human HRasp, which is a recognized pseudogene, does not contain reported base substitutions and instead encodes the human orthologue of ERas. This protein contains amino-acid residues identical to those present in active mutants of Ras and causes oncogenic transformation in NIH 3T3 cells. ERas interacts with phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase but not with Raf. ERas-null ES cells maintain pluripotency but show significantly reduced growth and tumorigenicity, which are rescued by expression of ERas complementary DNA or by activated phosphatidylinositol-3-OH kinase.

Human embryonic stem cells will remain undifferentiated or undergo differentiation when grown in conditioned or non-conditioned medium, respectively. The factors and signaling events that control the maintenance of the undifferentiated state are not well characterized and their identification is of major importance. Based on the data from global expression analyses, we set out to identify genes and the signaling pathways controlling them that are regulated in the early phase of the differentiation process. This study shows that nodal and the inhibitors of Nodal signaling, lefty-A and lefty-B, are down-regulated very early upon differentiation. High expression of these genes in undifferentiated cells is maintained by activation of the transcription factor Smad2/3, downstream of the activin-linked kinases (ALK) 4/5/7. Treatment of differentiating cells with Activin A leads to activation of Smad2/3 and expression of nodal, lefty-A and lefty-B, while inhibition of ALK4/5/7 by the kinase inhibitor SB-431542 blocks activation of Smad2/3 and expression of these genes in the undifferentiated state. In addition, when cells are maintained undifferentiated by treatment with the GSK3-inhibitor, BIO, high expression of nodal, lefty-A, and lefty-B also requires activation of ALK4/5/7. Conversely, BMP signaling leading to Smad1/5/8 activation via ALK2/3/6 is blocked in undifferentiated cells and becomes activated upon differentiation. Taken together, these observations establish that Smad2/3 is activated in undifferentiated hESCs and required for the expression of genes controlling Nodal signaling.

Genetic manipulation of their expression ratios reveals that Smad3 contributes essential signals at early post-implantation stages. Thus, loss of Smad3 in the context of one wild-type copy of Smad2 results in impaired production of anterior axial mesendoderm, while selective removal of both Smad2 and Smad3 from the epiblast additionally disrupts specification of axial and paraxial mesodermal derivatives.

Human ES cells can proliferate without a known limit and can form advanced derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers. What is less widely appreciated is that human ES cells can also form the extra-embryonic tissues that differentiate from the embryo before gastrulation. The use of human ES cells to derive early human trophoblast is particularly valuable, because it is difficult to obtain from other sources and is significantly different from mouse trophoblast. Here we show that bone morphogenetic protein 4 (BMP4), a member of the transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF-\u03b2) superfamily, induces the differentiation of human ES cells to trophoblast. DNA microarray, RT-PCR, and immunoassay analyses demonstrate that the differentiated cells express a range of trophoblast markers and secrete placental hormones. When plated at low density, the BMP4-treated cells form syncytia that express chorionic gonadotrophin (CG). These results underscore fundamental differences between human and mouse ES cells, which differentiate poorly, if at all, to trophoblast. Human ES cells thus provide a tool for studying the differentiation and function of early human trophoblast and could provide a new understanding of some of the earliest differentiation events of human postimplantation development.", "PublicationYear": "2002", "Authors": ["Ren-He Xu", "Xin Chen", "Dong Sheng Li", "Rui Li", "Gregory C.

Fibroblast growth factor 2 (FGF2) is known to promote self\u2010renewal of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). In addition, it has been shown that transforming growth factor \u03b2 (TGF\u03b2) signaling is crucial in that the TGF\u03b2/Activin/Nodal branch of the pathway needs to be activated and the bone morphogenic protein (BMP)/GDF branch repressed to prevent differentiation. This holds particularly true for Serum Replacement\u2010based medium containing BMP\u2010like activity. We have reinvestigated a widely used protocol for conditioning hESC medium with mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs). We show that FGF2 acts on MEFs to release supportive factors and reduce differentiation\u2010inducing activity. FGF2 stimulation experiments with supportive and nonsupportive MEFs followed by genome\u2010wide expression profiling revealed that FGF2 regulates the expression of key members of the TGF\u03b2 pathway, with Inhba, Tgfb1, Grem1, and Bmp4 being the most likely candidates orchestrating the above activities. In addition, restimulation experiments in hESCs combined with global expression analysis revealed downstream targets of FGF2 signaling in these cells. Among these were the same factors previously identified in MEFs, thus suggesting that FGF2, at least in part, promotes self\u2010renewal of hESCs by modulating the expression of TGF\u03b2 ligands, which, in turn, act on hESCs in a concerted and autocrine manner.", "PublicationYear": "2007", "Authors": ["Boris Greber", "Hans Lehrach", "James Adjaye"], "RelatedTopics": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "References": ["ed9a6c34f1da82f155eae196e9cc9fcc3c6f9459", "04028085c4d5585c7044d71717be6e2a57c7641d", "3f9497b8216f4acf331804a2f4b584066b1ab094", "567365c2522a4d88c7ef4a75e24668829f602b65", "931b3299b61d769dbf7d94ebfbd48e50ecaf2473", "7fa779ef385b024a2c43f6c294eff23e9e0ae997", "6ea0c87f9dd2808bdb4a4a870555edf66fd501bb", "e0ac9215da2b8b3377fd93ad65e6750b5bb1f245", "90b33ee4467bd758bdd49edd1f51017fe96c0a04", "1abd4b73ca8663759b0caa7ef10e08289af14d56"], "ReferenceCount": 62, "CitationCount": 256}, {"URL": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Direct-Binding-of-Smad1-and-Smad4-to-Two-Distinct-Lo%CC%81pez-Rovira-Chalaux/aee5e6bcbc80c7ae45a02aafea7e6b45b20c2e0b", "ID": "aee5e6bcbc80c7ae45a02aafea7e6b45b20c2e0b", "Title": "Direct Binding of Smad1 and Smad4 to Two Distinct Motifs Mediates Bone Morphogenetic Protein-specific Transcriptional Activation ofId1 Gene*", "Abstract": "The simultaneous requirement of two independent DNA binding elements to allow functional cooperativity of B MP-regulated Smads and Smad4 in BMP-activated gene promoters is suggested. Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are potent inhibitors of myoblast differentiation and inducers of bone formation both in vivo and in vitro. Expression of Id1, a negative regulator of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors, is up-regulated by BMPs and contributes to the antimyogenic effects of this family of cytokines. In this report, we have identified a specific BMP-2 immediate early response enhancer in the human Id1gene. Transcriptional activation of the enhancer was increased by overexpression of BMP-responsive Smads, and Smad4 and was completely abrogated in Smad4-deficient cells. Deletion analysis demonstrates that the responsive region is composed of two separate DNA binding elements, a set of overlapping GC boxes, which bind BMP-regulated Smads upon BMP stimulation, and three repeats of CAGAC boxes. Gel shift and oligonucleotide pull-down assays demonstrated that these two types of motifs were capable of binding their corresponding Smads. However, deletion or mutation of either DNA binding element was nonadditive, since disruption of either GC or CAGAC boxes resulted in complete or severe loss of BMP-2 responsiveness.

Maintenance of pluripotency is crucial to the mammalian embryo's ability to generate the extra-embryonic and embryonic tissues that are needed for intrauterine survival and foetal development. The recent establishment of embryonic stem cells from human blastocysts (hESCs) provides an opportunity to identify the factors supporting pluripotency at early stages of human development. Using this in vitro model, we have recently shown that Nodal can block neuronal differentiation, suggesting that TGF\u03b2 family members are involved in cell fate decisions of hESCs, including preservation of their pluripotency. Here, we report that Activin/Nodal signalling through Smad2/3 activation is necessary to maintain the pluripotent status of hESCs. Inhibition of Activin/Nodal signalling by follistatin and by overexpression of Lefty or Cerberus-Short, or by the Activin receptor inhibitor SB431542, precipitates hESC differentiation. Nevertheless, neither Nodal nor Activin is sufficient to sustain long-term hESC growth in a chemically defined medium without serum. Recent studies have shown that FGF2 can also maintain long-term expression of pluripotency markers, and we find that inhibition of the FGF signalling pathway by the tyrosine kinase inhibitor SU5402 causes hESC differentiation. However, this effect of FGF on hESC pluripotency depends on Activin/Nodal signalling, because it is blocked by SB431542. Finally, long-term maintenance of in-vitro pluripotency can be achieved with a combination of Activin or Nodal plus FGF2 in the absence of feeder-cell layers, conditioned medium or Serum Replacer. These findings suggest that the Activin/Nodal pathway maintains pluripotency through mechanism(s) in which FGF acts as a competence factor and therefore provide further evidence of distinct mechanisms for preservation of pluripotency in mouse and human ESCs.", "PublicationYear": "2005", "Authors": ["Ludovic Vallier", "Morgan Alexander", "Roger A.

Nanog, Sox2, and Oct4 are transcription factors all essential to maintaining the pluripotent embryonic stem cell phenotype. Through a cooperative interaction, Sox2 and Oct4 have previously been described to drive pluripotent-specific expression of a number of genes.

Within the Nanog proximal promoter, we identify a composite sox-oct cis-regulatory element essential for Nanog pluripotent transcription.

A Nanog proximal promoter-EGFP (enhanced green fluorescent protein) reporter transgene recapitulates endogenous Nanog mRNA expression in embryonic stem cells and their differentiated derivatives.

Erythroid cell-specific gene regulation during terminal differentiation is controlled by transcriptional regulators, such as EKLF and GATA1, that themselves exhibit tissue-restricted expression patterns. Their early expression, already in evidence within multipotential hematopoietic cell lines, has made it difficult to determine what extracellular effectors and transduction mechanisms might be directing the onset of their own transcription during embryogenesis. To circumvent this problem, we have taken the novel approach of investigating whether the ability of embryonic stem (ES) cells to mimic early developmental patterns of cellular expression during embryoid body (EB) differentiation can address this issue. We first established conditions whereby EBs could form efficiently in the absence of serum. Surprisingly, in addition to mesoderm, these cells expressed hemangioblast and hematopoietic markers. However, they did not express the committed erythroid markers EKLF and GATA1, nor the terminally differentiated beta-like globin markers. Using this system, we determined that EB differentiation in BMP4 was necessary and sufficient to recover EKLF and GATA1 expression and could be further stimulated by the inclusion of VEGF, SCF, erythropoietin and thyroid hormone. EBs were competent to respond to BMP4 only until day 4 of differentiation, which coincides with the normal onset of EKLF expression. The direct involvement of the BMP/Smad pathway in this induction process was further verified by showing that erythroid expression of a dominant negative BMP1B receptor or of the inhibitory Smad6 protein prevented induction of EKLF or GATA1 even in the presence of serum. Although Smad1, Smad5 and Smad8 are all expressed in the EBs, BMP4 induction of EKLF and GATA1 transcription is not immediate. These data implicate the BMP/Smad induction system as being a crucial pathway to direct the onset of EKLF and GATA1 expression during hematopoietic differentiation and demonstrate that EB differentiation can be manipulated to study induction of specific genes that are expressed early within a lineage.", "PublicationYear": "2002", "Authors": ["Carrie A.

Bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) are morphogenetic signaling molecules essential for embryonic patterning. To obtain molecular insight into the influence of BMPs on morphogenesis, we searched for new genes directly activated by BMP signaling. In vitro cultured mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells were used, cultivated in chemically defined growth medium (CDM). CDM-cultured ES cells responded very selectively to stimulation by various mesoderm inducers (BMP2/4, activin A, and basic fibroblast growth factor). BMP2/4 rapidly induced transcript levels of the homeobox genes Msx-1 andMsx-2 and the proto-oncogene JunB, whereas c-jun transcripts displayed delayed albeit prolonged increase. Using differential display cDNA cloning, six direct BMP target genes were identified. These include Id3, which showed strong mRNA induction, and the moderately inducedCyr61, DEK, and eIF4AII genes, as well as a gene encoding a GC-binding protein. Besides Id3, also the Id1 and Id2 genes were activated by BMP4 in both ES cells and a range of different cell lines.Id genes encode negative regulators of basic helix-loop-helix transcription factors. In vivo we observed local ectopic expression of Id3 and Msx-2mRNAs in Ft/+ embryos at overlapping regions of ectopicBmp4 misexpression.

The differentiation of murine and human embryonic stem (ES) cells into pancreatic cell types has been shown by several methods including spontaneous differentiation, formation of multi-lineage progenitors, lineage selection or transgene expression. However, these strategies led to a mixture of cells of all three primary germ layers and only a low percentage of definitive endoderm cells giving rise to pancreas, liver, lung and intestine. To reproducibly generate functional insulin-producing cells, ES cells have to be differentiated via definitive endoderm and pancreatic endocrine progenitors recapitulating the in vivo development. Activin A, a member of the transforming growth factor beta superfamily, has been shown to induce definitive endoderm cells dependent on concentration, culture conditions and time of application. Moreover, serum components or contamination by feeder cells as well as differentiation and proliferation factors are critical for successful generation of activin A-induced ES cells into endoderm and pancreatic cells.

Human embryonic stem cells (hES cells) have unlimited self-renewal capacity and can differentiate into most, if not all, possible cell types. This unique property makes them valuable not only for investigation of early developmental processes, but also for regenerative medicine. Mesoderm-derived cardiac cells and hematopoietic cells both have the potential for various therapeutic applications. However, efficient induction of hES cell differentiation into mesoderm remains a challenge. Here, we showed that treatment of hES cells with bone morphogenetic protein-4 (BMP-4) exhibited differential effects: long-term treatment results in trophoblast and extra-embryonic endoderm differentiation, whereas short-term treatment can promote early mesoderm induction. The induction of mesoderm in hES cells occurs at a high efficiency as measured using several markers, such as Brachyury, WNT3, and MIXL1 expression.

Activin/Nodal signaling is necessary to maintain pluripotency of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) and to induce their differentiation toward endoderm. However, the mechanisms by which Activin/Nodal signaling achieves these opposite functions remain unclear. To unravel these mechanisms, we examined the transcriptional network controlled in hESCs by Smad2 and Smad3, which represent the direct effectors of Activin/Nodal signaling. These analyses reveal that Smad2/3 participate in the control of the core transcriptional network characterizing pluripotency, which includes Oct\u20104, Nanog, FoxD3, Dppa4, Tert, Myc, and UTF1. In addition, similar experiments performed on endoderm cells confirm that a broad part of the transcriptional network directing differentiation is downstream of Smad2/3. Therefore, Activin/Nodal signaling appears to control divergent transcriptional networks in hESCs and in endoderm. Importantly, we observed an overlap between the transcriptional network downstream of Nanog and Smad2/3 in hESCs; whereas, functional studies showed that both factors cooperate to control the expression of pluripotency genes. Therefore, the effect of Activin/Nodal signaling on pluripotency and differentiation could be dictated by tissue specific Smad2/3 partners such as Nanog, explaining the mechanisms by which signaling pathways can orchestrate divergent cell fate decisions.

Deletion of various bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) and their downstream Smads in mice have clearly shown that BMP signaling is essential for the formation of primordial germ cells (PGCs).

Here, we demonstrate that BMP4 produced in the extraembryonic ectoderm signals through ALK2, a type I BMP receptor, in the visceral endoderm (VE) to induce formation of PGCs from the epiblast. Firstly, embryonic day 5.5-6.0 (E5.5-E6.0) embryos cultured on fibronectin formed PGCs in the presence of VE, but not in its absence. Secondly, Alk2-deficient embryos completely lacked PGCs and the heterozygotes had reduced numbers, resembling Bmp4-deficient phenotypes. Thirdly, expression of constitutively active ALK2 in the VE, but not in the epiblast, was sufficient to rescue the PGC phenotype in Bmp4-deficient embryos. In addition, we show that the requirement for the VE at E5.5-E6.0 can be replaced by culturing embryos stripped of VE on STO cells, indicating that STO cells provide or transduce signals necessary for PGC formation that are normally transmitted by the VE.

Such small molecules will serve as useful chemical probes to study cardiac muscle differentiation and may ultimately facilitate the therapeutic application of ESCs for cardiac repair.", "PublicationYear": "2004", "Authors": ["Xu Wu", "Sheng Ding", "Qiang Ding", "Nathanael S.

Abstract In addition to their contribution to the research on early human development, human embryonic stem (hES) cells may also be used for cell-based therapies. Traditionally, these cells have been cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layers, which allow their continuous growth in an undifferentiated state. However, the use of hES cells in human therapy requires an animal-free culture system, in which exposure to mouse retroviruses is avoided. In this study we present a novel feeder layer-free culture system for hES cells, based on medium supplemented with 15% serum replacement, a combination of growth factors including transforming growth factor \u03b21 (TGF\u03b21), leukemia inhibitory factor, basic fibroblast growth factor, and fibronectin matrix. Human ES cells grown in these conditions maintain all ES cell features after prolonged culture, including the developmental potential to differentiate into representative tissues of the three embryonic germ layers, unlimited and undifferentiated proliferative ability, and maintenance of normal karyotype. The culture system presented here has two major advantages: 1) application of a well-defined culture system for hES cells and 2) reduced exposure of hES cells to animal pathogens.

One of the earliest events in mammalian embryogenesis is the formation of the inner cell mass (ICM) and the subsequent delamination of primitive endoderm. We have found that mRNA for fibroblast growth factor (FGF)-4, but not FGF-3, is expressed in preimplantation mouse blastocysts and that the FGF-4 polypeptide is present in ICM cells. ICM-like embryonal carcinoma cells and embryonic stem cells also express FGF-4. Conversely, differentiated embryonal carcinoma cells in the endoderm lineage express FGF-3, but not FGF-4 mRNA. Although mouse embryos expressed FGF-4 mRNA from the 1-cell stage, embryos cultured from the 2-cell through the blastocyst stage in the presence of recombinant FGF-4 did not respond mitogenically. However, when ICMs that were isolated by immunosurgery were cultured with FGF-4, the number of morphologically distinct, differentiated parietal endoderm cells growing out onto the coverslip increased, without an increase in the number of undifferentiated ICM cells. ICM outgrowths cultured with FGF-4 increased their secretion of 92 x 10(3) M(r) gelatinase and tissue plasminogen activator, a hallmark of migrating cells. Receptors for FGF-4 (FGFR-3 and FGFR-4) are expressed in all cells of the mouse blastocyst.

Little is known about genes that govern the development of the definitive endoderm in mammals; this germ layer gives rise to the intestinal epithelium and various other cell types, such as hepatocytes, derived from the gut. The discovery that the rat hepatocyte transcription factor HNF3 is similar to the Drosophila forkhead gene, which plays a critical role in gut development in the fly, led us to isolate genes containing the HNF3/forkhead (HFH) domain that are expressed in mouse endoderm development. We recovered mouse HNF3 beta from an embryo cDNA library and found that the gene is first expressed in the anterior portion of the primitive streak at the onset of gastrulation, in a region where definitive endoderm first arises. Its expression persists in axial structures derived from the mouse equivalent of Hensen's node, namely definitive endoderm and notochord, and in the ventral region of the developing neural tube. Expression of the highly related gene, HNF3 alpha, appears to initiate later than HNF3 beta and is first seen in midline endoderm cells. Expression subsequently appears in notochord, ventral neural tube, and gut endoderm in patterns similar to HNF3 beta. Microscale DNA binding assays show that HNF3 proteins are detectable in the midgut at 9.5 days p.c. At later stages HNF3 mRNAs and protein are expressed strongly in endoderm-derived tissues such as the liver. HNF3 is also the only known hepatocyte-enriched transcription factor present in a highly de-differentiated liver cell line that retains the capacity to redifferentiate to the hepatic phenotype. Taken together, these studies suggest that HNF3 alpha and HNF3 beta are involved in both the initiation and maintenance of the endodermal lineage. We also discovered a novel HFH-containing gene, HFH-E5.1, that is expressed transiently in posterior ectoderm and mesoderm at the primitive streak stage, and later predominantly in the neural tube.

The maintenance of murine embryonic stem (ES) cell self-renewal is regulated by leukemia inhibitory factor (LIF)-dependent activation of signal transducer and activator of transcription 3 (STAT3) and LIF-independent mechanisms including Nanog, BMP2/4, and Wnt signaling. Here we demonstrate a previously undescribed role for phosphoinositide 3-kinases (PI3Ks) in regulation of murine ES cell self-renewal. Treatment with the reversible PI3K inhibitor, LY294002, or more specific inhibition of class IA PI3K via regulated expression of dominant negative \u0394p85, led to a reduction in the ability of LIF to maintain self-renewal, with cells concomitantly adopting a differentiated morphology. Inhibition of PI3Ks reduced basal and LIF-stimulated phosphorylation of PKB/Akt, GSK3\u03b1/\u03b2, and S6 proteins. Importantly, LY294002 and \u0394p85 expression had no effect on LIF-induced phosphorylation of STAT3 at Tyr705, but did augment LIF-induced phosphorylation of ERKs in both short and long term incubations. Subsequently, we demonstrate that inhibition of MAP-Erk kinases (MEKs) reverses the effects of PI3K inhibition on self-renewal in a time- and dose-dependent manner, suggesting that the elevated ERK activity observed upon PI3K inhibition contributes to the functional response we observe. Surprisingly, upon long term inhibition of PI3Ks we observed a reduction in phosphorylation of \u03b2-catenin, the target of GSK-3 action in the canonical Wnt pathway, although no consistent alterations in cytosolic levels of \u03b2-catenin were observed, indicating this pathway is not playing a major role downstream of PI3Ks.

Mouse ES (embryonic stem) cells maintain pluripotency with robust proliferation in vitro. ES cells share some similarities with cancer cells, such as anchorage-independent growth, loss of contact inhibition and tumour formation. After differentiation, ES cells lose pluripotency and tumorigenicity. Recent studies showed that the PI3K (phosphoinositide 3-kinase) pathway is important for proliferation, survival and maintenance of pluripotency in ES cells. The PI3K pathway is activated by growth factors and cytokines including insulin and leukaemia inhibitory factor. In addition to these exogenous factors, the PI3K pathway is endogenously activated by the constitutively active Ras family protein ERas (ES cell-expressed Ras).

Murine ES cells can be maintained as a pluripotent, self-renewing population by LIF/STAT3-dependent signaling. The downstream effectors of this pathway have not been previously defined. In this report, we identify a key target of the LIF self-renewal pathway by showing that STAT3 directly regulates the expression of the Myc transcription factor. Murine ES cells express elevated levels of Myc and following LIF withdrawal, Myc mRNA levels collapse and Myc protein becomes phosphorylated on threonine 58 (T58), triggering its GSK3\u03b2 dependent degradation. Maintained expression of stable Myc (T58A) renders self-renewal and maintenance of pluripotency independent of LIF. By contrast, expression of a dominant negative form of Myc antagonizes self-renewal and promotes differentiation. Transcriptional control by STAT3 and suppression of T58 phosphorylation are crucial for regulation of Myc activity in ES cells and therefore in promoting self-renewal.

The MUC1 protein is aberrantly expressed on an estimated 75% of all human solid tumor cancers. We recently reported that a transmembrane cleavage product, MUC1*, is the predominant form of the protein on cancer cells [1]. Further, our evidence indicated that MUC1* functions as a growth factor receptor on tumor cells, while the full-length protein appeared to have no growth promoting activity. Here, we report that MUC1* acts as a growth factor receptor on undifferentiated human embryonic stem cells (hESCs). Cleavage of the full-length ectodomain to form MUC1*, a membrane receptor, appears to make binding to its ligand, NM23, possible. Unexpectedly, we found that newly differentiated cells no longer express the cleaved form, MUC1*, or its ligand, NM23. Newly differentiated stem cells exclusively present full-length MUC1. Antibody-induced dimerization of the MUC1* receptor on hESCs stimulated cell growth to a far greater degree than currently used methods that require the addition of exogenous basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF) as well as factors secreted by fibroblast \u201cfeeder cells\u201d. Further, MUC1* mediated growth was shown to be independent of growth stimulated by bFGF or the milieu of factors secreted by feeder cells. Stimulating the MUC1* receptor with either the cognate antibody or its ligand NM23 enabled hESC growth in a feeder cell-free system and produced pluripotent colonies that resisted spontaneous differentiation. These findings suggest that this primal growth mechanism could be utilized to propagate large numbers of pluripotent stem cells for therapeutic interventions.", "PublicationYear": "2008", "Authors": ["Sherry.

We recently reported a novel method to induce embryonic stem (ES) cells differentiate into an endodermal fate, especially pancreatic, using a supporting cell line. Here we describe the modified culture condition with the addition and withdrawal of secreted growth factors could induce ES cells to selectively differentiate into a hepatic fate efficiently. The signaling of BMP and FGF that have been implicated in hepatic differentiation during normal embryonic development are shown to play pivotal roles in generating hepatic cells from the definitive endoderm derived from ES cells. Moreover, the expression of AFP, Albumin or a biliary molecular marker appeared sequentially thus suggested the differentiation of ES cells recapitulated normal developmental processes of liver. The ES cell\u2010derived differentiated cells showed evidence of glycogen storage, secreted Albumin, exhibited drug metabolism activities and expressed a set of cytochrome or drug conjugate enzymes, drug transporters specifically expressed in mature hepatocytes. With the same procedure, human ES cells also gave rise to cells with mature hepatocytes\u2019 characteristics.

Pluripotent embryonic stem (ES) cells can be a source of hepatocytes for bioartificial livers or transplantation. In this study, embryoid bodies (EBs) were formed from ES cells cultured in polypropylene conical tubes. The EBs were then inserted into a collagen scaffold three-dimensional culture system and stimulated with exogenous growth factors and hormones to induce hepatic histogenesis. The EB-derived cells expressed liver-specific genes, and albumin-positive cells formed cord-like structures that were not present in two-dimensional monolayer culture systems. However, these albumin- positive cells were not cytokeratin 18 positive. Electron microscopy showed immature hepatocyte- like cells having tight junctions, rough endoplasmic reticulum, and intercellular canaliculi. The scaffold including EB-derived hepatocyte-like cells was transplanted into the median lobes of partially hepatectomized nude mice. After 7 and 14 days, cells positive for both albumin and cytokeratin 18 appeared in the transplant and formed clustered aggregates.

Human embryonic stem (hES) cells hold promise as an unlimited source of cells for transplantation therapies. However, control of their proliferation and differentiation into complex, viable 3D tissues is challenging. Here we examine the use of biodegradable polymer scaffolds for promoting hES cell growth and differentiation and formation of 3D structures. We show that complex structures with features of various committed embryonic tissues can be generated, in vitro, by using early differentiating hES cells and further inducing their differentiation in a supportive 3D environment such as poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid)/poly(l-lactic acid) polymer scaffolds. We found that hES cell differentiation and organization can be influenced by the scaffold and directed by growth factors such as retinoic acid, transforming growth factor \u03b2, activin-A, or insulin-like growth factor. These growth factors induced differentiation into 3D structures with characteristics of developing neural tissues, cartilage, or liver, respectively. In addition, formation of a 3D vessel-like network was observed. When transplanted into severe combined immunodeficient mice, the constructs continue to express specific human proteins in defined differentiated structures and appear to recruit and anastamose with the host vasculature.

Embryonic stem cells have the ability to remain undifferentiated and proliferate indefinitely in vitro while maintaining the potential to differentiate into derivatives of all three embryonic germ layers. These cells have, therefore, potential for in vitro differentiation studies, gene function, and so on. The aim of this study was to produce a human embryonic stem cell line. An inner cell mass of a human blastocyst was separated and cultured on mouse embryonic fibroblasts in embryonic stem cell medium with related additives. The established line was evaluated by morphology; passaging; freezing and thawing; alkaline phosphatase; Oct-4 expression; anti-surface markers including Tra-1-60 and Tra-1-81; and karyotype and spontaneous differentiation. Differentiated cardiomyocytes and neurons were evaluated by transmission electron microscopy and immunocytochemistry. Here, we report the derivation of a new embryonic stem cell line (Royan H1) from a human blastocyst that remains undifferentiated in morphology during continuous passaging for more than 30 passages, maintains a normal XX karyotype, is viable after freezing and thawing, and expresses alkaline phosphatase, Oct-4, Tra-1-60, and Tra-1-81. These cells remain undifferentiated when grown on mouse embryonic fibroblast feeder layers in the presence or absence of recombinant human leukemia inhibitory factor.

Human embryonic stem (ES) cells are pluripotent cells derived from the inner cell mass of in vitro fertilized human blastocysts. We examined the potential of eight growth factors [basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), transforming growth factor beta1 (TGF-beta1), activin-A, bone morphogenic protein 4 (BMP-4), hepatocyte growth factor (HGF), epidermal growth factor (EGF), beta nerve growth factor (betaNGF), and retinoic acid] to direct the differentiation of human ES-derived cells in vitro. We show that human ES cells that have initiated development as aggregates (embryoid bodies) express a receptor for each of these factors, and that their effects are evident by differentiation into cells with different epithelial or mesenchymal morphologies. Differentiation of the cells was assayed by expression of 24 cell-specific molecular markers that cover all embryonic germ layers and 11 different tissues. Each growth factor has a unique effect that may result from directed differentiation and/or cell selection, and we can divide the overall effects of the factors into three categories: growth factors (Activin-A and TGFbeta1) that mainly induce mesodermal cells; factors (retinoic acid, EGF, BMP-4, and bFGF) that activate ectodermal and mesodermal markers; and factors (NGF and HGF) that allow differentiation into the three embryonic germ layers, including endoderm.

The differentiation of embryonic stem (ES) cells into hepatocyte-like cells has been reported in several papers. Mouse ES cells have shown a potential to develop into hepatocyte-like cells in vitro on the basis of hepatic gene expression after adding several growth factors. We transplanted cultured embryoid body (EB) cells (male) into female mice. A liver specimen of the recipient was examined by immunohistochemical staining for albumin and fluorescence in situ hybridization for the Y chromosome after transplantation. Both Y chromosome- and albumin-positive cells were recognized in the recipient female liver, and were considered to be hepatocyte-like cells derived from ES cells containing the Y chromosome. Many groups, including ourselves, have studied hepatocyte-like cell differentiation from umbilical cord blood cells (UBCs). We cultured nucleated cells isolated from UBCs.

Embryonic stem (ES) cells are clonal cell lines derived from the inner cell mass of the developing blastocyst that can proliferate extensively in vitro and are capable of adopting all the cell fates in a developing embryo. Clinical interest in the use of ES cells has been stimulated by studies showing that isolated human cells with ES properties from the inner cell mass or developing germ cells can provide a source of somatic precursors. Previous studies have defined in vitro conditions for promoting the development of specific somatic fates, specifically, hematopoietic, mesodermal, and neurectodermal. In this study, we present a method for obtaining dopaminergic (DA) and serotonergic neurons in high yield from mouse ES cells in vitro. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the ES cells can be obtained in unlimited numbers and that these neuron types are generated efficiently. We generated CNS progenitor populations from ES cells, expanded these cells and promoted their differentation into dopaminergic and serotonergic neurons in the presence of mitogen and specific signaling molecules. The differentation and maturation of neuronal cells was completed after mitogen withdrawal from the growth medium.

However, the utility of ES cells as a developmental model or as a source of defined cell populations for pharmaceutical screening or transplantation is compromised because their differentiation in vitro is poorly controlled. Specification of primary lineages is not understood and consequently differentiation protocols are empirical, yielding variable and heterogeneous outcomes. Here we report that neither multicellular aggregation nor coculture is necessary for ES cells to commit efficiently to a neural fate. In adherent monoculture, elimination of inductive signals for alternative fates is sufficient for ES cells to develop into neural precursors. This process is not a simple default pathway, however, but requires autocrine fibroblast growth factor (FGF).

The derivation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs), whose in vitro differentiation might be directed toward different cell types, has raised the hope for cell replacement therapies. Despite the emerging reports to differentiate hESCs into specific lineages and then to distinct mature cell subsets, there are still several issues that need to be resolved before transplantation of these cells can be realized. In this context, immune rejection by the host immune system has been considered to be one of the greatest hurdles for cellular transplantation. However, recent data support the concept that hESCs and/or their differentiated derivatives possess immune-privileged properties, suggesting that cells derived from hESC may provide a potential tool for induction of immunetolerance. Currently, our understanding of the tolerogenic potential of hESCs is limited to assessment by in vitro assays or xenogenic transplantation approaches in vivo. Human ESCs express low levels of major histocompatability complex (MHC)-I antigens and lack expression of MHC-II antigens and costimulatory molecules, and are not recognized by natural killer cells and inhibit T-cell induced-stimulation by third-party antigen-presenting cells. Upon injection into immunocompetent mice, hESCs are unable to induce an immune response as demonstrated by their inability to induce an inflammatory response. Based on these initial observations, further studies in hESCs immunobiology are warranted and may reveal unique mechanisms that account for the immunological properties of hESCs.

Human embryonic stem (hES) cells are defined by their extensive self-renewal capacity and their potential to differentiate into any cell type of the human body. The challenge in using hES cells for developmental biology and regenerative medicine has been to direct the wide differentiation potential toward the derivation of a specific cell fate. Within the nervous system, hES cells have been shown to differentiate in vitro into neural progenitor cells, neurons, and astrocytes. However, to our knowledge, the selective derivation of any given neuron subtype has not yet been demonstrated. Here, we describe conditions to direct hES cells into neurons of midbrain dopaminergic identity. Neuroectodermal differentiation was triggered on stromal feeder cells followed by regional specification by means of the sequential application of defined patterning molecules that direct in vivo midbrain development. Progression toward a midbrain dopamine (DA) neuron fate was monitored by the sequential expression of key transcription factors, including Pax2, Pax5, and engrailed-1 (En1), measurements of DA release, the presence of tetrodotoxin-sensitive action potentials, and the electron-microscopic visualization of tyrosinehydroxylase-positive synaptic terminals. High-yield DA neuron derivation was confirmed from three independent hES and two monkey embryonic stem cell lines.

Pluripotent stem cells are derived from the inner cell mass of preimplantation embryos, and display the ability of the embryonic founder cells by forming all three germ lineages in vitro. It is well established that the cellular niche plays an important role in stem cell maintenance and differentiation. Stem cells generally have limited function without the specialized microenvironment of the niche that provides key cell-cell contact, soluble mediators, and extracellular matrices. We were interested in the role that Wnt signaling, in particular Wnt3a, played in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) differentiation to hepatic endoderm in vitro. hESC differentiation to hepatic endoderm was efficient in pure stem cell populations. However, in younger hESC lines, generating stromal cell mesenchyme, our model was very inefficient. The negative effect of stroma could be reversed by pretreating hESCs with Wnt3a prior to the onset of hepatocyte differentiation. Wnt3a pretreatment reinstated efficient hESC differentiation to hepatic endoderm.

The potential to differentiate human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) in vitro to provide an unlimited source of human hepatocytes for use in biomedical research, drug discovery, and the treatment of liver diseases holds great promise. Here we describe a three\u2010stage process for the efficient and reproducible differentiation of hESCs to hepatocytes by priming hESCs towards definitive endoderm with activin A and sodium butyrate prior to further differentiation to hepatocytes with dimethyl sulfoxide, followed by maturation with hepatocyte growth factor and oncostatin M. We have demonstrated that differentiation of hESCs in this process recapitulates liver development in vivo: following initial differentiation, hESCs transiently express characteristic markers of the primitive streak mesendoderm before turning to the markers of the definitive endoderm; with further differentiation, expression of hepatocyte progenitor cell markers and mature hepatocyte markers emerged sequentially. Furthermore, we have provided evidence that the hESC\u2010derived hepatocytes are able to carry out a range of hepatocyte functions: storage of glycogen, and generation and secretion of plasma proteins. More importantly, the hESC\u2010derived hepatocytes express several members of cytochrome P450 isozymes, and these P450 isozymes are capable of converting the substrates to metabolites and respond to the chemical stimulation.

Previous studies using a tetracycline\u2010regulated Oct\u20104 transgene in the ZHBTc4 cell line demonstrated that downregulation of Oct\u20104 expression induced dedifferentiation into trophoblast, a lineage mouse ES cells do not normally generate.

The differentiation capacity of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) holds great promise for therapeutic applications. We report a novel three\u2010stage method to efficiently direct the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into hepatic cells in serum\u2010free medium. Human ESCs were first differentiated into definitive endoderm cells by 3 days of Activin A treatment. Next, the presence of fibroblast growth factor\u20104 and bone morphogenetic protein\u20102 in the culture medium for 5 days induced efficient hepatic differentiation from definitive endoderm cells. Approximately 70% of the cells expressed the hepatic marker albumin. After 10 days of further in vitro maturation, these cells expressed the adult liver cell markers tyrosine aminotransferase, tryptophan oxygenase 2, phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (PEPCK), Cyp7A1, Cyp3A4 and Cyp2B6. Furthermore, these cells exhibited functions associated with mature hepatocytes including albumin secretion, glycogen storage, indocyanine green, and low\u2010density lipoprotein uptake, and inducible cytochrome P450 activity. When transplanted into CCl4 injured severe combined immunodeficiency mice, these cells integrated into the mouse liver and expressed human alpha\u20101 antitrypsin for at least 2 months. In addition, we found that the hESC\u2010derived hepatic cells were readily infected by human immunodeficiency virus\u2010hepatitis C virus pseudotype viruses. Conclusion: We have developed an efficient way to direct the differentiation of human embryonic stem cells into cells that exhibit characteristics of mature hepatocytes. Our studies should facilitate searching the molecular mechanisms underlying human liver development, and form the basis for hepatocyte transplantation and drug tests.

The capacity for self-renewal and differentiation of human embryonic stem (ES) cells makes them a potential source for generation of pancreatic beta cells for treating type I diabetes mellitus. Here, we report a newly developed and effective method, carried out in a serum-free system, which induced human ES cells to differentiate into insulin-producing cells. Activin A was used in the initial stage to induce definitive endoderm differentiation from human ES cells, as detected by the expression of the definitive endoderm markers Sox17 and Brachyury. Further, all-trans retinoic acid (RA) was used to promote pancreatic differentiation, as indicated by the expression of the early pancreatic transcription factors pdx1 and hlxb9. After maturation in DMEM/F12 serum-free medium with bFGF and nicotinamide, the differentiated cells expressed islet specific markers such as C-peptide, insulin, glucagon and glut2. The percentage of C-peptide-positive cells exceeded 15%. The secretion of insulin and C-peptide by these cells corresponded to the variations in glucose levels. When transplanted into renal capsules of Streptozotocin (STZ)-treated nude mice, these differentiated human ES cells survived and maintained the expression of beta cell marker genes, including C-peptide, pdx1, glucokinase, nkx6.1, IAPP, pax6 and Tcf1. Thirty percent of the transplanted nude mice exhibited apparent restoration of stable euglycemia; and the corrected phenotype was sustained for more than six weeks.

A panel of genetic markers was used to assess the in vitro commitment of murine embryonic stem (ES) cells toward the endoderm\u2010derived pancreas and to distinguish insulin\u2010expressing cells of this lineage from other lineages such as neuron, liver, and yolk sac. There are two nonallelic insulin genes in mice. Neuronal cells express only insulin II, whereas the pancreas expresses both insulin I and II. Yolk sac and fetal liver express predominately insulin II, small amounts of insulin I, and no glucagon. We found that ES\u2010derived embryoid bodies cultured in the presence of stage\u2010specific concentrations of monothio\u2010glycerol and 15% fetal calf serum, followed by serum\u2010free conditions, give rise to a population that expresses insulin I, insulin II, pdx\u20101 (a pancreas marker), and Sox17 (an endoderm marker).

Aims/hypothesisThe relative lack of successful pancreatic differentiation of human embryonic stem cells (hESCs) may suggest that directed differentiation of hESCs into definitive endoderm and subsequent commitment towards a pancreatic fate are not readily achieved. The aim of this study was to investigate whether sequential exposure of hESCs to epigenetic signals that mimic in vivo pancreatic development can efficiently generate pancreatic endodermal cells, and whether these cells can be further matured and reverse hyperglycaemia upon transplantation.Materials and methodsThe hESCs were sequentially treated with serum, activin and retinoic acid (RA) during embryoid body formation. The patterns of gene expression and protein production associated with embryonic germ layers and pancreatic endoderm were analysed by RT-PCR and immunostaining. The developmental competence and function of hESC-derived PDX1-positive cells were evaluated after in vivo transplantation.ResultsSequential treatment with serum, activin and RA highly upregulated the expression of the genes encoding forkhead box protein A2 (FOXA2), SRY-box containing gene 17 (SOX17), pancreatic and duodenal homeobox 1 (PDX1) and homeobox HB9 (HLXB9). The population of pancreatic endodermal cells that produced PDX1 was significantly increased at the expense of ectodermal differentiation, and a subset of the PDX1-positive cells also produced FOXA2, caudal-type homeobox transcription factor 2 (CDX2), and nestin (NES). After transplantation, the PDX1-positive cells further differentiated into mature cell types producing insulin and glucagon, resulting in amelioration of hyperglycaemia and weight loss in streptozotocin-treated diabetic mice.Conclusions/interpretationOur strategy allows the progressive differentiation of hESCs into pancreatic endoderm capable of generating mature pancreatic cell types that function in vivo.

BACKGROUND & AIMS\\nNew sources of beta cells are needed to develop cell therapies for patients with diabetes. An in vitro, sequential method has been developed to derive pancreatic progenitors, but this technique has not been used for other cell lines. We investigated whether definitive endoderm derived from human embryonic stem (hES) cells might be used to create beta cells.\\n\\n\\nMETHODS\\nFive hES cell lines were induced to form pancreatic progenitors and analyzed for pancreas markers. Cells were incubated with a bone morphogenetic protein (BMP) antagonist, retinoids, a Hedgehog antagonist, or fibroblast growth factor (FGF) and phenotypes were analyzed.\\n\\n\\nRESULTS\\nFour hES cell lines sequentially generated definitive endoderm, primitive gut, and posterior foregut equivalents, as described previously. However, functional hepatocytes, rather than pancreas progenitors, developed. Consistent with liver development, FGF and BMP signaling pathways were involved in this process; their inhibition disrupted hepatocyte differentiation. During early stages of development, exposure of cells to noggin and retinoid acid, followed by FGF10, generated pancreatic cells (PDX1+; 50%-80%) that coexpressed FOXA2, HNF6, and SOX9.\\n\\n\\nCONCLUSIONS\\nThese findings demonstrate the combined functions of endogenous BMP and supplemented FGF in inducing differentiation of hepatocytes from hES cells and the ability to shift developmental pathways from hepatic to pancreatic cell differentiation.

The development of functional cell populations such as hepatocytes and pancreatic \u03b2 cells from embryonic stem cell (ESC) is dependent on the efficient induction of definitive endoderm early in the differentiation process. To monitor definitive endoderm formation in mouse ESC differentiation cultures in a quantitative fashion, we generated a reporter cell line that expresses human CD25 from the Foxa3 locus and human CD4 from the Foxa2 locus. Induction of these reporter ESCs with high concentrations of activin A led to the development of a CD25\u2010Foxa3+CD4\u2010Foxa2+ population within 4\u20105 days of culture. Isolation and characterization of this population showed that it consists predominantly of definitive endoderm that is able to undergo hepatic specification under the appropriate conditions. To develop reagents that can be used for studies on endoderm development from unmanipulated ESCs, from induced pluripotent stem cells, and from the mouse embryo, we generated monoclonal antibodies against the CD25\u2010Foxa3+CD4\u2010Foxa2+ population. With this approach, we identified two antibodies that react specifically with endoderm from ESC cultures and from the early embryo. The specificity of these antibodies enables one to quantitatively monitor endoderm development in ESC differentiation cultures, to study endoderm formation in the embryo, and to isolate pure populations of culture\u2010 or embryo\u2010derived endodermal cells.

One key step in producing insulin-secreting cells from human embryonic stem (hES) cells is the generation of pancreatic and duodenal homeobox gene 1 (PDX1)-expressing pancreatic progenitor cells. All-trans retinoic acid (RA) has important roles in pancreas development and is widely used to induce pancreatic differentiation of ES cells. When RA was added directly to the activin A-induced hES cells, &lt;20% cells were positive for the pancreatic marker PDX1, whereas the other cells were mainly hepatic cells. We found that when the activin A-induced hES cells were replated and seeded at low cell densities, the addition of RA induced significant pancreatic differentiation and over 70% of cells in culture expressed PDX1. When the endodermal cells were isolated with the surface marker CXCR4 from the activin A-induced culture and further differentiated with RA, a homogeneous PDX1(+) cell population (over 95% pure) was generated. The PDX1(+) cells could further differentiate into cells that expressed pancreatic transcription factors and pancreatic endocrine or exocrine markers. We also found that RA inhibited the hepatic differentiation of endodermal cells that were seeded at low cell densities, and this inhibition may have been through the inhibition of Smad1/5/8 activity. Thus, we present a highly efficient and reproducible protocol for generating PDX1(+) pancreatic progenitor cells from hES cells.", "PublicationYear": "2010", "Authors": ["Jun Cai", "Chen Yu", "Yanxia Liu", "Song Chen", "Yuxuan Guo", "Jun Yong", "Wei Qun Lu", "Mingxiao Ding", "Hongkui Deng"], "RelatedTopics": ["Biology", "Medicine"], "References": [], "ReferenceCount": 0, "CitationCount": 112}, {"URL": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Formation-of-Pluripotent-Stem-Cells-in-the-Embryo-Nichols-Zevnik/6951b07392f74682bb38e9ce75c5d6fdffb2f4e1", "ID": "6951b07392f74682bb38e9ce75c5d6fdffb2f4e1", "Title": "Formation of Pluripotent Stem Cells in the Mammalian Embryo Depends on the POU Transcription Factor Oct4", "Abstract": "Semantic Scholar extracted view of \\\"Formation of Pluripotent Stem Cells in the Mammalian Embryo Depends on the POU Transcription Factor Oct4\\\" by J.

Many problems in applied machine learning deal with graphs (also called networks), including social networks, security, web data mining, protein function prediction, and genome informatics. The kernel paradigm beautifully decouples the learning algorithm from the underlying geometric space, which renders graph kernels important for the aforementioned applications. In this article, we give a new graph kernel, which we call graph traversal edit distance (GTED). We introduce the GTED problem and give the first polynomial time algorithm for it. Informally, the GTED is the minimum edit distance between two strings formed by the edge labels of respective Eulerian traversals of the two graphs. Also, GTED is motivated by and provides the first mathematical formalism for sequence co-assembly and de novo variation detection in bioinformatics. We demonstrate that GTED admits a polynomial time algorithm using a linear program in the graph product space that is guaranteed to yield an integer solution. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first approach to this problem. We also give a linear programming relaxation algorithm for a lower bound on GTED. We use GTED as a graph kernel and evaluate it by computing the accuracy of a support vector machine (SVM) classifier on a few data sets in the literature. Our results suggest that our kernel outperforms many of the common graph kernels in the tested data sets.

MotivationIntimately tied to assembly quality is the complexity of the de Bruijn graph built by the assembler. Thus, there have been many paradigms developed to decrease the complexity of the de Bruijn graph. One obvious combinatorial paradigm for this is to allow the value of k to vary; having a larger value of k where the graph is more complex and a smaller value of k where the graph would likely contain fewer spurious edges and vertices. One open problem that affects the practicality of this method is how to predict the value of k prior to building the de Bruijn graph. We show that optimal values of k can be predicted prior to assembly by using the information contained in a phylogenetically-close genome and therefore, help make the use of multiple values of k practical for genome assembly.ResultsWe present HyDA-Vista, which is a genome assembler that uses homology information to choose a value of k for each read prior to the de Bruijn graph construction. The chosen k is optimal if there are no sequencing errors and the coverage is sufficient. Fundamental to our method is the construction of the maximal sequence landscape, which is a data structure that stores for each position in the input string, the largest repeated substring containing that position. In particular, we show the maximal sequence landscape can be constructed in O(n + n log n)-time and O(n)-space. HyDA-Vista first constructs the maximal sequence landscape for a homologous genome. The reads are then aligned to this reference genome, and values of k are assigned to each read using the maximal sequence landscape and the alignments. Eventually, all the reads are assembled by an iterative de Bruijn graph construction method. Our results and comparison to other assemblers demonstrate that HyDA-Vista achieves the best assembly of E. coli before repeat resolution or scaffolding.AvailabilityHyDA-Vista is freely available [1]. The code for constructing the maximal sequence landscape and choosing the optimal value of k for each read is also separately available on the website and could be incorporated into any genome assembler.", "PublicationYear": "2014", "Authors": ["Seyed Basir Shariat Razavi", "Narjes Sadat Movahedi Tabrizi", "Hamidreza Chitsaz", "Christina Boucher"], "RelatedTopics": ["Computer Science"], "References": ["dada61b80069b6d22815089421b6cb18402336dc", "491a17f486e085ad341b90cf8536b8ce57ef1f97", "661753d13ca4629bdd42f24b6c66284025f20521", "9cbccbe327e51dffd5c9b8b3199b6958d000b902", "70e828b75a683e2c6f025a45d4f91d45756c0ade", "904d025230e97e9587ec144dff6c7b241f8b726c", "540cb7e61b8b6000ee11e0ee1def93e7ecf66934", "cccdadaba3b4b598d0d963b9c9d431cec24c4bd4", "af4c52fc1560f915044209c77161e414b004a365", "92c5dda3fe4a96c6f3e7bda8582aca46df07863d"], "ReferenceCount": 43, "CitationCount": 12}, {"URL": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/Identification-of-common-molecular-subsequences.-Smith-Waterman/40c5441aad96b366996e6af163ca9473a19bb9ad", "ID": "40c5441aad96b366996e6af163ca9473a19bb9ad", "Title": "Identification of common molecular subsequences.", "Abstract": "Semantic Scholar extracted view of \\\"Identification of common molecular subsequences.\\\" by Temple F.

These extensions are then tested on benchmark experiments of chemical compounds classification, with promising results.", "PublicationYear": "2004", "Authors": ["Pierre Mah{\\'e}", "Nobuhisa Ueda", "Tatsuya Akutsu", "Jean-Luc Perret", "Jean-Philippe Vert"], "RelatedTopics": ["Computer Science"], "References": ["2dfd92c808487049ab4c9b45db77e9055b9da5a2", "44a07a1fc4143cab722751197b12dde3dcc6032b", "647fdaacfcea319677175464b7db39e3b22c7808", "60de4b6068407defa3c88f5feeb8b74d8e55fe9c", "05357314fe2da7c2248b03d89b7ab9e358cbf01e", "71f9fb2ac8c724d19e336d83a47484f2f33cce3d", "73aaa386f93bbdea33184fdceacdbb9d9bd24cf8", "508fbfbfb09768c92d35e5fae10ce8fa7e8753d2", "ef77a8b0db638c675d032bd05dc3a012a2899da4", "69b316e545a7d7eefa9d9ce510cdd17601daaff0"], "ReferenceCount": 12, "CitationCount": 213}, {"URL": "https://www.semanticscholar.org/paper/On-Graph-Kernels%3A-Hardness-Results-and-Efficient-G%C3%A4rtner-Flach/647fdaacfcea319677175464b7db39e3b22c7808", "ID": "647fdaacfcea319677175464b7db39e3b22c7808", "Title": "On Graph Kernels: Hardness Results and Efficient Alternatives", "Abstract": "As most \u2018real-world\u2019 data is structured, research in kernel methods has begun investigating kernels for various kinds of structured data, but only very specific graphs such as trees and strings have been considered. As most \u2018real-world\u2019 data is structured, research in kernel methods has begun investigating kernels for various kinds of structured data. One of the most widely used tools for modeling structured data are graphs. An interesting and important challenge is thus to investigate kernels on instances that are represented by graphs.

A new kernel function between two labeled graphs is presented. Feature vectors are defined as the counts of label paths produced by random walks on graphs. The kernel computation finally boils down to obtaining the stationary state of a discrete-time linear system, thus is efficiently performed by solving simultaneous linear equations. Our kernel is based on an infinite dimensional feature space, so it is fundamentally different from other string or tree kernels based on dynamic programming.
